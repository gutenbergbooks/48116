<h2>TO THE READER.</h2>

<p>This little volume has been republished, at
the earnest solicitation of numerous friends and
applicants, and with such additions and improvements
as the present extended state of information
appeared to render necessary. In obeying this
call, the author trusts that he may, in some
degree, remove the prejudice to which the carelessness
of his provincial compositor must, on
the former occasion, have exposed the work.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the first Edition,
<span class="smcap">Penzance</span>, and the District of the Mount's Bay,
have become objects of greatly increased interest;
the successful establishment of the Geological
Society,&mdash;the erection of commodious Sea Baths,&mdash;the
growing confidence of the Public, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the medical profession, in the superior mildness
of the climate,&mdash;and the general amelioration of
every thing connected with the wants and comforts
of a winter residence, have powerfully
operated in augmenting the influx of strangers
and invalids, into this formerly obscure, and
comparatively neglected district. Such considerations,
it will be acknowledged, were quite sufficient
to sanction the propriety and expediency
of the present undertaking, but the author must
in candour allow, that they would scarcely have
prevailed, had not another powerful motive been
in silent but effectual co-operation&mdash;the "<i>Antiquæ
vestigia Flammæ</i>,"&mdash;a secret lingering after the
pursuits of Geology have, for once at least, seduced
him from a resolution he had formed on
quitting Cornwall,&mdash;that of abandoning a science
which can never be pursued except with enthusiasm;
but which, from its direction and tendency,
is wholly incompatible with the duties of an
anxious and laborious profession.</p>

<p>As the work is calculated for the guidance of
those who may seek the shores of the Mount's
Bay, for its genial atmosphere, the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
of some general observations upon the subject
of Climate, appeared essentially necessary. For
this purpose, the form of a Dialogue has been
preferred to that of a Didactic essay; by which
much circumlocution is avoided, while the only
interesting parts of the question are thus made
to appear in a more prominent and popular point
of view.</p>

<p>The Cornish Dialogue, introduced in the
Appendix, for the sake of illustrating the provincial
Dialect, has been composed after the
model of the well known "<i>Tim Bobbin</i>," which
was written for the accomplishment of the same
object, with reference to Lancashire. From the
direction in which it came into the hands of the
author, he is inclined to consider it as an hitherto
unpublished production of the celebrated Dr.
Walcott.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Valete</span>.</p>

<big>A GUIDE</big><br />
<small>TO THE</small><br />
<big>MOUNT'S BAY</big><br />
<small>AND</small><br />
<big>THE LAND's END.</big><br />
</div>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<div class="center">
<i>Of the Mount's Bay, and the Land's End District.</i>
</div>

<p class="space-above">At the most western extremity, and in the
lowest latitude of Great Britain, is situated this
delightful and justly celebrated Bay. It is bounded
by an irregularly curved outline of many miles
in extent, the extreme points of which constitute
the well known promontory of the "<i>Lizard</i>," and
the singular headland, "<i>Tol-Pedn-Penwith</i>,"
near the "<i>Land's End</i>."</p>

<p>From the Lizard, the shores pass northward
and westward, and gradually losing, as they
proceed, their harsh and untamed features, swell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
into sloping sweeps of richly cultivated land,
and into hills glowing with the freshest verdure.
As the coast advances, and at the same time
spreads itself southward, it unites to its luxuriant
richness a bolder character, and, rising like a
vast amphitheatre, it opposes a barrier to western
storms, while it presents its undulating bosom to
the sun, and collecting his rays, pours them
again with multiplied effect, upon every part
of the surrounding country. The shores now
pass westward, and extend to the <i>Land's End</i>,
in their approach to which they become more
rocky and precipitous, and occasionally exhibit
some of the finest cliff scenery in the island,
displaying by splendid natural sections the exact
structure and relations of the rocks of which the
country is composed.</p>

<p>The western shores are sprinkled with picturesque
villages, churches, cottages, and villas;
and near the eastern margin of the bay, a pile of
rocks, supporting a venerable chapel on its summit,
starts abruptly from the waves, and presents
an appearance of a most singular and beautiful
description&mdash;this is <i>Saint Michael's Mount</i>,
an eminence equally celebrated in the works of
the poet, the naturalist, the antiquary, and the
historian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>If we pursue the coast, and, turning round the
western extremity of our island, trace its outline
as it proceeds northerly, and then easterly to the
<i>Bay of St. Ives</i>, a very different country presents
itself; instead of the undulating curves, and
luxuriant herbage of the southern shores, the
land is generally high,&mdash;the vallies short, narrow,
and quick of descent, and the whole landscape
affords a scene of incomparable cheerlessness;
on the summit of almost every hill the granite is
to be seen protruding its rugged forms in the
most fantastic shapes, while the neighbouring
ground is frequently covered for some distance
with its disjointed and gigantic fragments, tumbled
together in magnificent confusion; scarcely
a shrub is seen to diversify the waste, and the
traveller who undertakes to explore the more
desolate parts of the district, will feel as if he
were walking over the ruins of the globe, and
were the only being who had survived the general
wreck; and yet Ulysses was not more attached
to his Ithaca, than is the Cornish peasant to his
wild and cheerless dwelling.</p>

<div class="poem">
"Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,<br />
"And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms."<br />
</div>

<p>Nor let the intelligent tourist despair of amusement,
for he will find much to interest, much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
delight him. There is not perhaps a district in
Great Britain which presents greater attractions
to the mineralogist or geologist; and there is
certainly not one which, in so small a compass,
has produced so many species of earthy and metallic
minerals, or which displays so many geological
varieties. At the same time the antiquarian
may here occupy himself with the examination of
the rude relics of antiquity, which lie scattered
on all sides&mdash;nothing is more pleasing than that
sacred enthusiasm which is kindled in the mind
by the contemplation of the faded monuments of
past ages, and surely no spot was ever more congenial
to such sensations. But to return from
the digression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Climate</span> of Mount's Bay is the circumstance
which has principally contributed to its
celebrity, and is that which renders its shores so
beneficial to invalids. Its seasons have been
aptly compared to the neap tides, which neither
ebb nor flow with energy; for, notwithstanding
its southern latitude, the summer is never sultry,
while the rigour of winter is so ameliorated, that
thick ice<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is rarely seen; frost, if it occurs, is but
of a few hours duration; and the snow storms
which, coming from the north and east, bury the
fields of every other part of England, are generally
exhausted before they reach this favoured
spot, or their last sprinkling is dissolved by the
warm breezes which play around its shores.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>The records lately collated and published by
Dr. Forbes, from the meteorological journals of
Messrs. Giddy, eminent surgeons at Penzance,
afford abundant proof that this neighbourhood
enjoys a mean summer temperature <i>under</i>, and
a mean winter temperature greatly <i>above</i>, the
mean of places similarly situated as to latitude,
but differing in the latter being placed at a distance
from the sea; for the mass of water held in
the vast basin of the ocean preserves a far more
even temperature than the atmosphere, and is
constantly at work to maintain some degree of
equilibrium in the warmth of the air; so that in
the summer it carries off a portion of the caloric
from it, while in the winter it restores a part of
that which it contains.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>The same registers have, moreover, recorded a
fact with respect to the Penzance climate which
renders it still more acceptable to the invalid,&mdash;the
comparatively small annual, monthly, and
daily range of its temperature. Nor are the indications
of the thermometer the only test upon
which we need rely,&mdash;the productions of nature
will furnish striking elucidations, and amply confirm
the justness of our meteorological observations.
From the vegetable kingdom we derive
conclusive evidence of the mildness of our winter,
since all green-house plants may be preserved
with far less care and attendance than in any
other part of England; myrtles<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and geraniums,
even of the tenderest kind, and many other exotics,
are here constantly exposed during the winter,
and yet they flower most luxuriantly in the
summer. The <i>Hydrangea</i> attains an immense
size in our shrubberies, as does also the <i>Verbena
Triphylla</i>. The great American aloe (<i>Agave
Americana</i>,) has flowered in the open air at
Mousehole, at Tehidy park, and in the Scilly
islands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
To these we may add a long list<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of
tender exotics, all of which are flourishing in the
neighbourhood of Penzance, and it has been justly
remarked that were ornamental horticulture to
become an object of attention in this neighbourhood,
as it is in many other parts of England,
this list might be very considerably extended.
Amongst the rare <i>indigenous</i> plants of this district,
the <i>Sibthorpia Europæa</i> may be particularised
as affording a remarkable proof of the
mildness of our winter. This elegant little plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
when transplanted into the midland counties is
killed even in the most sheltered gardens. Nor
must we pass over unnoticed the more substantial
proofs of the same fact, as furnished by our winter
markets, for at a season when pot-herbs of all
kinds are destroyed by frost in the eastern counties,
our tables are regularly supplied in abundance;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and so little is the progress of vegetation
checked during the months of winter, that
the meadows retain their verdure, and afford even
a considerable supply of grass to the cattle.</p>

<p>Nor is the animal kingdom deficient in proofs
of the congenial mildness of western Cornwall.
We are indebted to the <i>Rev. W. T. Bree</i>, of
Allesley, Warwickshire, for the following remarks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
which were communicated by him to Dr. Forbes
of Penzance, and published by that gentleman
in his Observations on the Climate of this
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"One of the most remarkable instances of the
mildness of your climate is the unusually early
appearance of frog's spawn: this I observed at
Gulval on the 8th of January. According to
White's Naturalist's Calendar (which was made
from observations taken in Hampshire, a warm
and early county,) the earliest and latest appearances
there specified, are February 28th, and
March 22d. Taking therefore the second week
in March as the average for its appearance, you
should seem, in this instance, to be full two
months earlier than Hampshire."</p>

<p>"In this neighbourhood (near Coventry) I
rarely see any of our species of Swallow, except
perhaps an occasional straggler, before the second
week in April, but in the year 1818 I was not a
little gratified at observing upwards of a score of
Sand Martins, (<i>Hirundo Riparia</i>,) sporting over
the marsh between Gulval and Marazion, on
March 31st. The wind at that time was N. W.
and the thermometer at 50° in the shade at noon.
The Chaffinch (<i>Fringilla C&oelig;lebs</i>,) I heard, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Cornwall, begin to chirp his spring note the last
day of December. With us he is seldom heard
until the beginning of February. The Viper,
(<i>Coluber Berus</i>) a great lover of warmth and
moisture, occurs more frequently in Cornwall
than in the midland counties."</p>

<p>We have already stated that our summers are
as remarkable for coolness, as our winters are desirable
for mildness. This circumstance necessarily
renders our fruit inferior in flavour to that
which is produced in the inland counties; indeed
the grape very rarely ripens in the open air, and
the apricot tree seldom affords any fruit, except
in a few favoured spots. The tree of the greengage
plum is nearly equally unproductive. The
walnut and the common hazel-nut very seldom
bear fruit. Apples for the table, however, are
plentiful and good; and our strawberries may be
considered as possessing a decided superiority.</p>

<p>Why then, it may be asked, should not this
climate be as eligible to invalids as that which
they are generally sent across the Channel to
enjoy? In reply we will venture to assert, and
without the least fear of being contradicted by
those, whose experience renders them competent
judges, that it is not only equally beneficial, but
far more eligible, unless, indeed, the patient can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
possess himself of the cap of Fortunatus, to remove
the difficulties and discomfiture of a continental
journey. But since the present volume
is, in some measure, written for the information
and guidance of those who are seeking a winter's
residence, in pursuit of health, the author has
been induced to subjoin a short essay, in the appendix,
for the purpose of examining the comparative
pretensions of the several places to the
reputation for superior mildness and salubrity,
which they have acquired.</p>

<p>From the peninsular situation of Cornwall, and
its proximity to the Atlantic ocean, over which
the wind blows, at least, three-fourths of the
year, the weather is certainly very subject to
rain, and it is found that when other parts of
England suffer from drought, Cornwall has rarely
any reason to complain; this peculiarity seems
highly congenial to the inhabitants, as well as to
the soil; a Cornishman never enjoys better health
and spirits than in wet seasons, and there is a
popular adage, that "<i>the land will bear a shower
every day, and two upon a sunday</i>;" this, like most
of our popular sayings, although it requires to be
understood with some grains of allowance, is
founded on observation and experience. The
philosophical explanation of the fact is obvious;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the shallowness of the soil, and the large proportion
of siliceous matter which enters into its composition,
together with the nature of its rocky
substratum, necessarily render a constant supply
of moisture indispensable to its fertility. And
we here cannot but admire the intelligence displayed
by Nature in connecting the wants and
necessities of the different parts of Creation with
the power and means of supplying them; thus in
a primitive country, like Cornwall, where the
soil is constantly greedy of moisture, we perceive
that the rocks, elevated above the surface, solicit
a tribute from every passing cloud; while in alluvial
and flat districts, the soil of which is rich,
deep, and retentive of water, the clouds float
undisturbed over the plains, and the country very
commonly enjoys that long and uninterrupted
series of dry weather which is so congenial and
essential to its productions.</p>

<p>It deserves, however, to be noticed, that the
rains of Cornwall are, in general, rather frequent
than heavy.</p>

<div class="poem">
"Not such as wintry storms on mortals shed<br />
Oppressing life, but lovely, gentle, kind,<br />
And full of every hope, and every joy,<br />
The wish of Nature."&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p>It has been satisfactorily ascertained, by means
of the rain guage, that the actual quantity of rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that falls is rather under the mean of the whole
of England; and Dr. Borlase observes that "we
have very seldom a day so thoroughly wet, but
that there is some intermission, nor so cloudy,
but that the sun will find a time to shine." This
circumstance may, perhaps, in part depend upon
the narrow, ridgelike form of the peninsula, over
which the winds make a quick, because they have
a short passage, and therefore do not suffer the
clouds to hang long in one place, as they frequently
do in other situations; we are, besides,
much indebted to Ireland for this moderation of
the elements; she may be truly denominated the
<i>Umbrella</i> of Cornwall, for were not the vast body
of clouds, which the winds bring from the Atlantic,
attracted and broken by her hills, we should
most probably be deluged with more constant and
excessive rain.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the supposed moisture of the
Mount's Bay, the air is not less fit for respiration,
nor less beneficial to the valetudinarian, than that
of drier situations. The porous nature of the
shelfy substratum soon disposes of any excess of
water; so that, after a short cessation of rain,
the invalid may safely venture abroad to enjoy
the delightful walks which surround the bay; at
the same time, the numerous promontories which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
distinguish this coast, promote a constant circulation
of breezes around their extremities, so that
mists seldom linger, and we never experience
those sultry calms, or suffocating fogs, which not
unfrequently infest other parts of our island.</p>

<p>As Cornwall is directly exposed to the expanse
of the Atlantic ocean, lying south-west of it, we
cannot be surprised that the winds, which blow
so generally from that quarter, should occasionally
produce very violent storms. Their approach
is frequently predicted by the experienced fisherman,
from the agitation of the water along shore,
a phenomenon which is called a "<i>ground swell</i>;"
and which is probably occasioned by a storm in
the Atlantic, with the wind west; in which case,
as the storm proceeds eastward, the waves raised
by it will outgo the wind, and reach the eastern
coast long before it. A tremendous instance of
this kind occurred, during the residence of the
author of these pages, on the night of Sunday,
January 19th, 1817. The storm assumed the
character of a hurricane, and acting in conjunction
with a spring tide, impelled the waves with
such fury, that they actually broke over the mast
heads of the vessels which were lying within Penzance
harbour, and bore down every thing before
them; two of the four pillars recently erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
for the reception of a light were thrown down,
and several of the foundation stones of the pier
removed. The windows of the bath-house were
demolished, and the whole of its furniture washed
into the sea. The green between Penzance and
Newlyn was torn up, and several boats, lying on
the strand were actually carried into the neighbouring
meadows. The towns of Newlyn and
Mousehole suffered corresponding damage, and
several of their houses were washed away. The
road between Marazion and St. Michael's Mount
was torn from its lowest foundation, and stones
of more than a ton in weight, though clamped
together with massy iron, were severed and removed
from their situation. The turnpike road
between Penzance and Marazion was, in many
places, buried with sand; and in others, broken
up by the violence of the waves, and covered by
the sea to the depth of from three to five feet.
Had the violence of the storm lasted but a few
hours longer, who will venture to say that the
two channels would not have been united by the
inundation of the low land which constitutes the
isthmus, and the district of the Land's end been
converted into an island!</p>

<p>The sea is encroaching upon every part of the
Cornish coast. In the memory of many persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
still living, the cricketers were unable to throw a
ball across the "<i>Western Green</i>," between Penzance
and Newlyn,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which is now not many feet
in breadth, and the grandfather of the present
vicar of Madron is known to have received tithes
from the land under the cliff of Penzance. On
the northern coast we have striking instances of
the sea having made similar inroads. This however
is the natural result of the slow and silent
depredation of the water upon the land; but at a
very remote period we are assured by tradition,
that a considerable part of the present bay, especially
that comprehended within a line drawn
from near Cuddan point on the east side, to
Mousehole on the west, was land covered with
wood, but which, by an awful convulsion and
irruption of the sea, was suddenly swept away.
"If we trace the north-west shore of the bay,
from the Mount westward to Newlyn, the ebb
tide leaves a large space uncovered; the sea sand
is from one to two or three feet deep; and under
this stratum of sand is found a black vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
mould, full of woodland detritus, such as the
branches, leaves, and nuts of coppice wood, together
with the roots and trunks of forest trees
of large growth. All these are manifestly indigenous;
and, from the freshness and preservation
of some of the remains, the inundation of sand,
as well as water, must have been sudden and
simultaneous; and the circumstance of ripe nuts
and leaves remaining together would seem to
shew that the irruption happened in the autumn,
or in the beginning of winter. This vegetable
substratum has been traced seaward as far as the
ebb would permit, and has been found continuous
and of like nature. Another proof of these shores
having been suddenly visited by a tremendous
catastrophe, has been afforded by the nature of
the sand banks constituting the "<i>Eastern</i>," and
"<i>Western Greens</i>," and which will be found to
be the detritus of disintegrated granite; whereas
the natural sand, which forms the bed of the sea,
is altogether unlike it, being much more comminuted,
different in colour, and evidently the result
of pulverised clay-slate:"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but when did this
mighty catastrophe occur, and what were its
causes? These are questions which are not readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
answered; the event is so buried in the
depths of antiquity, that nothing certain or satisfactory
can be collected concerning it; although
it would appear from the concurrent testimony of
Florence of Worcester,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the Saxon Chronicles,
that a remarkable invasion of the ocean occurred
in November 1099. With respect to the causes
of the phenomenon we are equally uninformed;
let the geologist examine the appearance of the
coast with attention, and then decide with what
probability De Luc attributed the catastrophe to
a subsidence of the land. It must not, however,
be concealed that many geologists have questioned
the probability of the occurrence altogether,
and argue from the appearance of the
coast, "whose rocks beat back the envious siege
of watery Neptune," that no very important
change in the hydrographical outline of the Cornish
peninsula can have taken place, during the
present constitution of the earth's surface. If
Saint Michael's Mount be in reality the "<i>Ictis</i>"
of Diodorus Siculus, we have certainly a decisive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
proof that no material change has taken place for
the space of eighteen centuries at least; for the
Historian describes the access to this island precisely
such as it is at the present period&mdash;practicable
only at low water for wheel carriages.</p>

<p>Nor is the corroding operation of the other
elements upon the hills of Cornwall less evident
and striking; no where are the vestiges of degradation
more remarkable; granitic countries usually
present a bold and varied outline, whereas
the aspect of Cornwall, with some few exceptions,
is comparatively tame, and even flat. "<i>I went
into Cornwall</i>," said a geologist of well known
celebrity, "<i>to see an example of a primitive
country; but, instead of an example, I found an
exception</i>." The same observation would apply
to the agricultural character of the county, for
its fertility is much greater than that which
usually occurs in a country composed of primitive
rocks.</p>

<p>All that peninsular portion of Cornwall which
is situated to the westward of a line drawn from
the estuary of Hayle on the north, to Cuddan
point on the south, has been distinguished by
the appellation of the <i>Land's End District</i>. It
is about thirteen miles long from east to west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and five or six miles broad from north to south,
and contains, by superficial admeasurement about
54,000 statute acres. It has been remarked that
the small extent of this district, and its peninsular
character, preclude the existence of rivers of any
magnitude; its varied and uneven surface, however,
gives it a great profusion of small streams
and rivulets, which add greatly to its value. We
shall take occasion to introduce some remarks on
its agriculture, in our excursion to the Land's
End.</p>

before the end of March; <i>Broccoli</i>, against Christmas; <i>Green Peas</i>
are generally ready by the middle of May. But the most remarkable
exception, perhaps, to the ordinary routine of the culinary
calendar is to be found in the growth of the potatoe. It is customary
for the gardeners in the vicinity of Penzance to raise two
crops in one year. The first being planted in November is gathered
in April, May, and June; the second crop is planted immediately
on taking up the first, and as late as to the middle of July. The
first or spring crop has, in general, no other defence from the cold
of winter than the stable dung used as manure, and it is rarely
injured by the frost! Such is the ordinary practice of the market-gardener;
but Mr. Bolitho of Chyandour, has constantly new potatoes

<p>Having offered a rapid coup d'&oelig;il of the
country we are about to examine, we shall now
conduct the stranger into <i>Penzance</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> as being a
town well calculated to afford him an eligible
residence; many of the various objects of interest
are within the range of a morning's ride, and he
will meet with every accommodation that may be
required for the performance of his excursions;
if his pursuit be mineralogy and geology, it is in
this town that he will find others zealously engaged
in the study of the same science, from
whom he will readily obtain much local information;
while in the collection of the Geological
Society, so liberally opened for the inspection of
every scientific stranger, he will see well defined
specimens illustrative of the districts he may be
desirous of exploring.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>The reader of this Guide, therefore, must
thoroughly understand that in the arrangement
of the subsequent "Excursions," the various
objects of interest, to which it directs him, are
described in an order best adapted to the convenience
of the resident at Penzance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Penzance</span> is the most western market town in
the kingdom; about ten miles from the land's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
end, and 282 miles W.S.W. of London. It is
beautifully situated on the north-west shore of
the Mount's Bay, on a declivity jetting into the
sea. The lands in its vicinity having a substratum
of <i>hornblende rock</i> and <i>slate</i>, are not exceeded in
fertility by any soil in the kingdom; a belt of
land around the town, which consists of about
a thousand acres, producing an annual rent of
£10,000! The town is well defended by surrounding
hills from the fury of Atlantic storms.
It is large and populous, containing more than
six thousand inhabitants. The Corporation<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> consists
of a mayor, recorder, eight aldermen, and
twelve common-council men; by whose funds,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
unaided by any parliamentary grant, a very commodious
pier was erected about fifty years ago,
and which has lately been considerably extended,
so that it is now more than 600 feet in length, and
is the largest pier in Cornwall. It has, moreover,
received the addition of a light which is
displayed every night, from half flood to half
ebb, and is consequently extinguished as soon as
there is less than nine feet of water within the
pier. At high water there is now at Spring tides
22 feet<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of water, which is about five feet more
than that at the pier of Saint Michael's Mount.
The expenses incurred by these late improvements
are to be paid by a new tariff, established
by an act passed in the year 1817.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother church is situated at Madron, but
there is a chapel of ease in the town, dedicated to
Saint Mary, the simple and unassuming spire of
which forms a very interesting object in the bay.</p>

<p>Besides the established church, there are several
places of religious worship. The Wesleyan
Methodists' chapel, built in the year 1814, is the
most complete and capacious meeting-house in
the county. There are, moreover, appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
places of worship for the Independents, Baptists,
and Quakers, and a synagogue for the Jews.</p>

<p>Penzance is one of those towns to which the
tinners bring their tin to be "<i>coined</i>" as it is
called, that is, to be assayed and licensed by the
officers of the Duchy, who take off a piece from
the <i>corner</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of each block; and if they find it
sufficiently pure, stamp the former with the
Duke's arms. The stranger will be much struck
by the singular sight of many thousand blocks of
Tin, which lie in heaps, like worthless rubbish,
about the street,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> each weighing about 320 lb.
and may perhaps be worth from £18 to £20.
The Tin intended for the Mediterranean trade is
here formed into bars, while that designed for
exportation to the East Indies is cast into ingots.</p>

<p>There is a Public Dispensary, supported by the
voluntary contributions of the inhabitants, aided
occasionally by the donations of those invalid
strangers, who, grateful for the reestablishment of
health in themselves, eagerly adopt this mode of
contributing to its restoration in others. Few
institutions for the accomplishment of a similar
object, have proved more extensively beneficial;
and none, we will venture to add, were ever
superintended with more humane attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>To the scientific visitor, Penzance possesses
an interest of no ordinary degree. In the year
1814, <span class="smcap">Dr. Paris</span>, who was at that time the resident
physician, succeeded, through the support
of the nobility, gentry, and mine agents of the
county, in establishing a society for the cultivation
and promotion of mineralogical and geological
science; and, when we consider the immense
advantages of its locality, the ability of its members,
and the zeal and munificence of its patrons,
we cannot be surprised to find that the short
period of nine years has been sufficient to raise it
to a respectable rank amongst the eminent institutions
of this country. His present Majesty,
having graciously condescended to become its
patron, it is now denominated the <span class="smcap">Royal
Geological Society of Cornwall</span>. The
Marquis of Hertford, Lord Warden of the Stannaries,
and The Right Honourable Lord De
Dunstanville, are its Vice-Patrons, and Davies
Gilbert, Esq. M.P., the President; while amongst
its officers and members it has enrolled the names
of many individuals of the first rank and science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in the kingdom. Two volumes of the Society's
Transactions are already given to the public,
from which a fairer estimate may be formed of
the value of its labours, than from any sketch
which the limited pages of this "<i>Guide</i>" could
possibly afford; we shall, however, for the information
of our scientific readers, present, in
the <i>Appendix</i>, a list of the different memoirs
which each volume contains. The splendid and
extensive series of minerals, already exceeding
four thousand specimens, which are deposited in
an elegant and spacious museum,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> offers a most
honourable and durable testimony of the zeal
and talent with which this department has been
conducted; while to the student in mineralogy
it affords a most desirable and solid system of
instruction; indeed it has already excited such a
spirit of inquiry among the miners, as to have led
to the discovery of several minerals before unknown
in Cornwall.</p>

<p>There is also an &oelig;conomical department, containing
specimens in illustration of the various
changes which the ores of Tin, Copper, &amp;c. undergo
in the processes of dressing and smelting.
Models are likewise to be seen of the machinery
which is employed in such operations. The whole
has been admirably arranged under the skilful
direction of the Curator, <i>E. C. Giddy, Esq.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>In the geological department of the Museum
are complete series of specimens illustrative of
the serpentine formation of the <i>Lizard</i>,&mdash;of the
slate formation of the "<i>Land's End District</i>,"&mdash;of
the limestone formation of Veryan, and of the
hornblende rocks of St. Cleer near Liskeard.
There is besides an interesting series of "<i>Elvans</i>"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
from different levels in many of the principal
mines of the county, together with a collection
of veins of metallic and earthy substances.</p>

<p>Among the earthy minerals, we may particularize,
as unusually fine, the specimens of <i>Calcedony</i>,
<i>Sodalite</i>, <i>Haüyne</i>, <i>Petalite</i>, <i>Colophonite</i>,
<i>Vesuvian</i>, &amp;c. In the metallic department, we
may notice the <i>Carbonate of Lead</i>, <i>Specular Iron</i>,
<i>Arseniate of Iron</i>, <i>the Oxide, Carbonate, Arseniate
and Phosphate of Copper</i>, <i>Native Gold</i> from the
Tin-stream-works of Cornwall, <i>Arsenical Pyrites</i>,
<i>Uranite</i>, <i>Uran-ochre</i>, <i>Native Nickel</i>, &amp;c. Here
also may be seen a mineral, hitherto almost unknown,&mdash;<i>a
Sub-carburet of Iron</i>; it was analysed
by that late eminent chemist, the <i>Rev. W. Gregor</i>,
who received it from the hands of the <i>Rev. J.
Rogers</i> of Mawnan. It was found in a vein
about half an inch wide, intersecting either hard
<i>Clay-slate</i> or <i>Graywacké</i>. Among the saline minerals
in the cabinet are <i>Glauberite</i>, and <i>Sassoline</i>
or native Boracic acid.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>A Laboratory, containing the necessary apparatus
for analytical operations, is attached to the
establishment.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we will venture to affirm, that
the advantages and enjoyments which such societies
are calculated to afford are not only obtained
without any expense to the country in which
they are encouraged, but that they actually repay
<i>in wealth</i> and <i>emolument</i> much more than they
require for their support. Had the Cornish
Society been earlier called into existence, we
should never have heard of the most valuable
productions of our country having been thrown
into the sea, nor of their having been used as
materials for the repair of roads, or the construction
of cottages: on the contrary, how many
thousand tons of ore might have been gained?&mdash;how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
many years of unprofitable but expensive
labour saved? and how many individual adventurers
preserved from disappointment, or rescued
from ruin? Amongst the efforts made by this
Society to improve the theory and art of mining,
through the application of science, not the least
interesting and praiseworthy is that which relates
to the prevention of accidental explosion in the
methods of blasting rocks with gunpowder, by
the introduction of "<i>Safety Instruments</i>."</p>

<p>How little aware is the great mass of the community
at what an expense of human suffering
and misery the ordinary necessaries of civilized
life are obtained! Few of our readers, we will
venture to say, have ever heard of the dreadful
extent of the accidents which have occurred in
the mines of Cornwall from the use of <i>iron</i> rammers,
in the process of charging the rock with
gunpowder, in order to blast it. Hundreds have
been thus sent to an untimely grave, or, what
perhaps is still worse, have been so mutilated as
to remain blind and helpless objects of misery
for the rest of their days, while their wives and
children have been thus driven, in a state of destitution,
to the hard necessity of seeking from
charity that pittance which honest industry could
no longer supply. We must refer the reader for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a full account of this appalling subject to Dr.
Paris's Memoir, in the first volume of the Society's
Transactions, entitled "<i>On the Accidents which
occur in the Mines of Cornwall, in consequence of
the premature explosion of Gunpowder in blasting
rocks; and on the methods to be adopted for preventing
it, by the introduction of a Safety Bar,
and an instrument termed the Shifting Cartridge</i>."</p>

<p>We earnestly, therefore, entreat the Society to
persevere in those laudable efforts, which have
already ensured for it the respect of the learned,
and the gratitude of the public.&mdash;<i>Floreat.</i></p>

<p>Besides the instructive collection of the Geological
Society, the splendid cabinet of <i>Joseph Carne,
Esq.</i> may now be seen in this town, for since the
first edition of this "<i>Guide</i>," the Cornish Copper
Company have given up their smelting establishment
at Hayle, at which place <i>Mr. Carne</i> formerly
lived as the resident partner. Among the
principal excellencies of this collection we may
notice <i>Prehnite</i>, in a variety of forms; <i>Axinite</i> in
the usual forms of that mineral; <i>Stilbite</i> in flat
four-sided prisms, terminated by pyramids; <i>Mesotype</i>
radiated; <i>Garnets</i> in twelve, and twenty-four
sided crystals; <i>Pinite</i> in six and twelve sided
prisms; <i>Uranite</i> in quadrangular tables with the
angles sometimes truncated, and also in forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
much resembling cubes and octohedrons; <i>Uran-ochre</i>;
<i>Native Bismuth</i>; and <i>Specular Iron ore</i>,
little inferior in beauty to that brought from
Elba,&mdash;all of which are from Saint Just. From
other parts of Cornwall are <i>Sulphate of Lead</i>
(Vellenoweth Mine) in a variety of forms, more
especially in one resembling an octahedron;
<i>Grey Sulphuret of Copper</i> (Crenver mine), the
best defined crystals of which are very obtuse
dodecahedrons, and six sided prisms; in some
specimens the dodecahedron is so placed upon
the summit of a prism as to produce the whimsical
appearance of a nail, which from its rarity
is sought after by mineral collectors with considerable
avidity. Two specimens of rarity also
in this collection are the <i>Yellow</i>, and <i>Grey Sulphuret
of Copper</i>, in forms approaching that of
Cube; the latter is pseudomorphous.</p>

<p>The Penwith Agricultural Society holds its
meetings, and distributes its premiums, in this
town. Nothing can be more in place than such
an institution. Geology and Agriculture are
kindred sciences, and it has been truly observed
that there is no district in the British Empire
where the natural relations between the varieties
of soil and the subjacent rocks can be more easily
discovered and traced, or more effectually investigated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
than in the county of Cornwall; and no
where can the information which such an enquiry
is capable of affording, be more immediately and
successfully applied for the improvement of waste
lands, and the general advancement of agricultural
science.</p>

<p>The market of Penzance, for the goodness,
variety, and cheapness of its commodities, is certainly
not surpassed by any other in the kingdom;
to the great quantity of salt usually mixed with
the food of the swine, is perhaps to be attributed
the delicacy and richness of the pork; whilst,
owing to the fine pasturage of the neighbourhood,
the heifer beef is superior, beyond comparison,
to the Scotch. It is worthy also of notice, that
during the winter season the market is filled
with a variety of wild-fowl, woodcocks, snipes,
&amp;c. which are offered for sale at extremely
low prices. The market is held on Thursdays
and Saturdays; but every description of fish in
season, as <i>Red Mullet</i>, <i>John Doree</i>, <i>Turbot</i>, <i>Sole</i>,
<i>Mackarel</i>, <i>Whiting</i>, <i>Pilchard</i>, <i>Herring</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.
may be purchased from the Newlyn fish-women,
who are in daily attendance at their stalls, and
whose fine symmetry, delicate complexions, curling
ringlets, and the brilliancy of whose jet black
eyes, as they dart their rays from beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
shade of large gypsey hats of beaver, fill the traveller
with admiration.</p>

<p>We beg leave to introduce the reader to two
of these <i>Nymphs of the Cowel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 197px;">
<img src="images/i_b_034.jpg" width="197" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Whilst speaking of the delicacies of the table
we must not omit to mention the <i>clotted</i> or <i>clouted</i>
cream of this and the neighbouring county,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
a luxury with which the epicures of other parts
are wholly unacquainted.</p>

<p>The town of Penzance is rapidly extending
itself; new houses are continually rising in commanding
situations; and, since the publication of
the first edition of this work, <span class="smcap">Hot and Cold
Sea Baths</span> have been completed upon a suitable
scale of convenience. The waiting room belonging
to this establishment commands a prospect
of very singular beauty. St. Michael's Mount
rising boldly in front, forms a striking relief to
the extended line of coast which constitutes the
back ground; while the undulating shores on
the left, skirted by the little village of Chy'andour,
are well contrasted, on the opposite side,
with the busy scene of the pier, and the numerous
vessels in the harbour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>In enumerating the advantages this town holds
out as a residence to invalids, it deserves notice
that a packet sails every Friday to the Scilly
Islands, and returns on the following Tuesday.
The distance is about fourteen leagues, and, with
a fair wind, the passage is generally accomplished
in six hours; but with contrary winds it has
sometimes, though very rarely, exceeded two days.</p>

<p>In a town so remote from the metropolis, and
in a great degree insulated from the other parts
of the empire, it is not extraordinary that we
should find the traces of several very ancient
customs. The most singular one is, perhaps, the
celebration of the Eve of Saint John the Baptist,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
our town saint, which falls on Midsummer Eve;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and that of the Eve of Saint Peter, the patron of
fishermen. No sooner does the tardy sun sink
into the western ocean than the young and old of
both sexes, animated by the genius of the night,
assemble in the town, and different villages of
the bay, with lighted torches. Tar barrels having
been erected on tall poles in the market
place, on the pier, and in other conspicuous spots,
are soon urged into a state of vivid combustion,
shedding an appalling glare on every surrounding
object, and which when multiplied by numerous
reflections in the waves, produce at a distant
view a spectacle so singular and novel as to defy
the powers of description; while the stranger
who issues forth to gain a closer view of the festivities
of the town, may well imagine himself
suddenly transported to the regions of the furies
and infernal gods; or, else that he is witnessing,
in the magic mirror of Cornelius Agrippa, the
awful celebration of the fifth day of the Eleusinian
Feast;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> while the shrieks of the female
spectators, and the triumphant yells of the torch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
bearers, with their hair streaming in the wind,
and their flambeaus whirling with inconceivable
velocity, are realities not calculated to dispel
the illusion. No sooner are the torches burnt
out than the numerous inhabitants engaged in
the frolic, pouring forth from the quay and its
neighbourhood, form a long string, and, hand
in hand, run furiously through every street, vociferating
"an eye,"&mdash;"an eye,"&mdash;"an eye"!
At length they suddenly stop, and the two last of
the string, elevating their clasped hands, form
<i>an eye</i> to this enormous <i>needle</i>, through which
the <i>thread</i> of populace runs; and thus they continue
to repeat the game, until weariness dissolves
the union, which rarely happens before
midnight.</p>

<p>On the following day (<i>Midsummer day</i>) festivities
of a very different character enliven the
bay; and the spectator can hardly be induced to
believe that the same actors are engaged in both
dramas. At about four or five o'clock in the
afternoon, the country people, drest in their best
apparel, pour into Penzance from the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
villages, for the purpose of performing an
aquatic divertisement. At this hour the quay and
pier are crowded with holiday-makers, where a
number of vessels, many of which are provided
with music for the occasion, lie in readiness to
receive them. In a short time the embarkation
is completed, and the sea continues for many
hours to present a moving picture of the most
animating description.</p>

<p>Penzance is remarkable in history for having
been entered and burnt by the Spaniards, in the
year 1595. From time immemorial a prediction
had prevailed, that a period would arrive when
"<i>Some strangers should land on the rocks of
Merlin, who should burn Paul's Church, Penzance,
and Newlyn</i>." Of the actual accomplishment
of this prediction we receive a full account
from Carew, from which it would appear that on
the 23d of July, 1595, about two hundred men
landed from a squadron of Spanish gallies, on
the coast of Mousehole, when they set fire to the
church of Paul, and then to Mousehole itself.
Finding little or no resistance, they proceeded
to Newlyn,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and from thence to Penzance. Sir
Francis Godolphin endeavoured to inspire the
inhabitants with courage to repel these assailants;
but, so fascinated were they by the remembrance
of the ancient prophecy, that they fled in
all directions, supposing that it was useless to
contend against the destiny that had been predicted.
The Spaniards availing themselves of
this desertion, set it on fire in different places,
as they had already done to Newlyn, and then
returned to their galleys, intending to renew the
flames on the ensuing day; but the Cornish having
recovered from their panic, and assembled in
great numbers on the beach, so annoyed the
Spaniards with their bullets and arrows, that
they drew their galleys farther off, and availing
themselves of a favourable breeze, put to sea
and escaped.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that when the Spaniards
first came on shore, they actually landed on a
rock called "<i>Merlin</i>." The historian concludes
this narrative by observing that these were the
only Spaniards that ever landed in England as
enemies.</p>

<p>In recalling the historical events which have
invested this town with interest, we had nearly
omitted to state, that a tradition exists here, that
<i>Tobacco</i> was first smoked by <i>Sir Walter Raleigh</i>
in Penzance, on his landing from America. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the Philosopher of a future age Penzance will,
doubtless, as the birth place of the illustrious
<span class="smcap">Sir Humphry Davy</span>, be regarded with no
ordinary share of interest; and to those who may
be led to perform a pilgrimage to the early laboratory
of this highly gifted philosopher, the vignette
at the head of the present chapter will be
found materially useful in directing his steps.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>It would be inconsistent with the plan and
objects of the present work to enter into the details
of biography, that duty must be reserved for
an abler pen, we shall therefore only state that
the present distinguished President of the Royal
Society was born in this town in the year 1779,
and that after having received the earlier part of
his education under <i>Dr. Cardew</i> at Truro, he was
placed with a respectable professional gentleman
of Penzance, of the name of <i>Tonkin</i>, in order
that he might acquire a knowledge of the profession
of a surgeon and apothecary. His early
proofs of genius, however, having attracted a
gentleman well known for his strong perception
of character, he was fortunately removed to a
field better calculated to call forth the latent
energies of his mind. The result is too well
known to require comment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>In the vicinity of the town are delightful walks
through shady dingles, and over swelling hills,
from whose summits we catch the most delicious
sea and land prospects; and which are not a
little heightened in beauty and effect by the glowing
aerial tints so remarkably displayed in this
climate at the rising and setting of the sun. Here
too the Botanist may cull, in his rambles, a great
variety of rare indigenous plants; with a catalogue<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
of which we shall now close the present
chapter.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Penzance signifies, in Cornish, <i>Holy-head</i>, i. e. <i>holy headland</i>;
and the town appears to have been so called in consequence of a
small chapel, dedicated to that universal patron of fishermen, Saint
Anthony, having formerly stood on the projecting point near the
present quay. When it became necessary to adopt arms for the
town, the true origin of its name was forgotten or overlooked, and
the holy head of Saint John emblazoned. It would, however, appear
from the <i>Liber valorum</i>, that <i>Buriton</i> was the old name of
Penzance,&mdash;a sound which to the ear of the antiquary is full of historical
intelligence, for the addition of <i>Bury</i> to the name of a town
signified that it was a town with a castle; thus, <i>Buriton</i> signified
Bury-town, i. e. the Castle town. Some cellars near the quay are
to this day called the <i>Barbican</i> cellars; thus tradition points out
the castle to have been upon, or near, the site of the present chapel.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Penzance was first incorporated in the reign of king James, in
1614; which charter was confirmed by Charles II.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The history of these funds exhibits a curious instance of the
increase in value which property undergoes, in a series of years,
from the progressive improvements of the district in which it lies.
The revenue of the Corporation, nearly £2000 per annum, is derived
from an estate which was purchased from one Daniel, in the
year 1614, for the sum of £34, and 20 shillings a year fee farm rent,
payable out of the same to the vender and his representatives for
ever. This estate is described in the writings to be "a three corner
plot with a timber house (then) lately erected thereon, together
with the tolls, profits, and dues of the fairs, markets, and of the
pier." The increase of its value has arisen from the enlargement
of the market now held on the spot, and from the dues arising from
the improved and extended pier.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> We are desirous of recording this fact since it continues to be
erroneously stated in the publication called the "<i>Coasting Pilot</i>,"
as well as in all charts, to be only 13 feet, as it was before the improvements.
From the perpetuation of this error the masters of
vessels unacquainted with the place, refuse to credit the pilots,
when informed by them of the depth of the water.</p></div>

supposed, from the stamping of the Duke's arms, but from the
cutting off the <i>corner</i> of each block, from the French word <i>coin</i>, a
<i>corner</i>. For every cwt. so stamped, the Duke receives four shillings,
producing an annual revenue of £10,000.</p></div>

represented in the vignette at the head of this chapter, becoming
too small to accommodate the growing collection, a capacious and
handsome suite of rooms were erected in the year 1817; to which
are now attached a public library, and a room for the reception
of newspapers. The former was established in 1818, under the
auspices of Sir Rose Price, Bart. and with the support of above a
hundred subscribers in the neighbourhood.</p></div>

from heat, is peculiar to Devonshire, Cornwall, and the opposite
coast of Brittany, and is supposed to be of Celtic origin.
The butter obtained by beating up this cream does not differ much
in flavour from that procured by churning new cream, except the
process be carelessly conducted, when it will acquire a smoky taste.</p></div>

although brought into the Christian Calendar under the
sanction of John the Baptist. Those sacred fires "kindled about

the Torches</i>," because at night the men and women ran about with
them in imitation of Ceres, who, having lighted a torch at the fire
of Mount Ætna, wandered about from place to place, in search of
her daughter Proserpine. Hence may we not trace the high antiquity

<h2>EXCURSION I.</h2>

<div class="center">
TO SAINT MICHAEL'S MOUNT.<br />
<br />
<small>
"This precious stone, set in the silver sea!"<br />
<i>Richard II. Act 2. scene 1.</i>
</small>
</div>


<p>The traveller no sooner catches a glimpse of
this extraordinary feature in the bay, than he
becomes impatient to explore it; anticipating
this feeling we have selected it as an object for
his first excursion, and in its performance we
promise him an intellectual repast of no ordinary
kind.</p>

<p>To proceed to the Mount, by sea, the stranger
may embark at Penzance pier, from which it is
not more than two miles distant; by this arrangement
an opportunity will be afforded for witnessing
a fine panoramic view of the coast; should,
however, his inclination, or the "tyranny of the
winds and waves" oppose this project, he may
proceed by land through the little village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Chy'andour, over a semicircular beach covered
with fine sand of about three miles in extent.
Between this sand and the high road is the
"<i>Eastern Green</i>," celebrated as the habitat of
some rare plants, viz. <i>Panicum Dactylum</i> (in a
line with Gulval church); <i>Chironia Littoralis</i>;
<i>Alisma Damasonium</i>; <i>Neottia Spiralis</i>; <i>Euphorbia
Peplis</i>; <i>Euphorbia Paralias</i>; <i>Santolina Maritima</i>;
<i>Convolvulus Soldanella</i>, &amp;c. On the beach the Conchologist
may collect some fine specimens of the
<i>Echinus Cordatus</i>, which is the only shell ever
found there. In the marshes on the left side of the
road the common observer will be struck with
the extreme luxuriance of the <i>Nymphæa alba</i>,
while the Botanist may reap an ample harvest
of interesting plants, viz. splendid specimens of
<i>Montia Fontana</i>, as large as the figure of Micheli;
<i>Illecebrum Verticillatum</i>; <i>Sison Inundatum</i>; <i>Apium
Graveolens</i>; a rare variety of <i>Senechio Jacobæa</i>;
<i>Alisma Ranunculoides</i>; <i>Stellaria Uliginosa</i>;
<i>Pinguicula Lusitanica</i>; <i>Scirpus Fluitans</i>; <i>Exacum
Filiforme</i>; <i>Drosera Longifolia</i>; <i>Scutellaria
Minor</i>; <i>Myrica Gale</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Before our arrival at Saint Michael's Mount,
the only intermediate object worthy of notice is
the town of <span class="smcap">Marazion</span>, or <span class="smcap">Market Jew</span> as it
is sometimes called. It stands upon the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
shore, on the eastern shoulder of the bay, and is
well sheltered from cold winds by a considerable
elevation of land to the north; still, however, as
it is exposed to the south-west, which is the prevailing
wind, it is far less eligible as a place of
residence for invalids than Penzance.</p>

<p>The town contains more than 1100 inhabitants;
its principal support, if not its origin, according
to some authors, was derived from the resort of
pilgrims and other religious devotees to the
neighbouring sacred edifice on Saint Michael's
Mount; but its name was indisputably derived
from the Jews who traded here several centuries
ago, and held an annual <i>market</i> for selling various
commodities, and purchasing tin, and other
merchandize in return. In the reign of Queen
Elizabeth it obtained a charter, vesting its government
in a mayor, eight aldermen, and twelve
capital burgesses, with a power to hold a weekly
market, and two annual fairs. In the preamble
to this charter it is stated "that Marghaisewe
was a trading borough town of great antiquity,
and that it suffered considerable dilapidation in
the days of Edward VI., when a number of
rebellious people entered, and took possession
of the town, and laid many of the buildings in
ruin." From this disaster the town does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
appear to have ever recovered, while from the
growing importance of Penzance, the suppression
of the Priory, and the loss of the Pilgrims, from
whom it derived its principal resources, its consequence
gradually declined, until at length it
dwindled into its present condition.</p>

<p>It has been asserted on good authority, that
under this charter of Elizabeth, the town formerly
sent members to Parliament, and <i>Dr.
Borlase</i> in his manuscripts, mentions the names
of <i>Thomas Westlake</i>, and <i>Richard Mills, Esqrs.</i>
as those of the two members who were actually
returned for Marazion in the year 1658. It does
not, however, appear that they ever took their
seats. It would seem, moreover, from some
original letters which passed between the Sheriff
of Cornwall and the mayor of this borough, during
the protectorate of Cromwell, that the inhabitants
were solicitous to recover their long
neglected rights; but this effort proved ineffectual.</p>

<p>In going from Marazion to the Mount, we
pass a large insulated rock, known by the name
of the "<i>Chapel Rock</i>," whereon the Pilgrims,
who came to visit the Priory of Saint Michael,
are said to have performed certain devotionary
and superstitious ceremonies, in a kind of initiatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
chapel, previous to their admission to the
more sacred Mount; there is not, however, the
slightest vestige of any masonry to be discovered,
and it would therefore seem more probable that
it merely derived its name from its vicinity to
the shrine of Saint Michael. The rock is composed
of well marked <i>Greenstone</i>, resting on a
bed of <i>clay-slate</i>, and which, in its direction and
dip, will be found to correspond with the slaty
rock on the western base of the Mount.</p>

<p>We arrive at Saint Michael's Mount.&mdash;The
rock of which it is composed is of a conical form;
gradually diminishing from a broad, craggy base,
towards its summit, which is beautifully terminated
by the tower of a chapel, so as to form a
pyramidal figure. On its eastern base, is a small
fishing town, holding about 250 inhabitants; and
a commodious pier,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> capable of containing fifty
sail of small vessels, and which proves to the
proprietor of the Mount a considerable source of
revenue.</p>

<p>The height from low water mark to the top of
the chapel tower is about 250 feet, being 48 feet
higher than the monument in London. In circumference
at the base, the Mount measures
nearly a mile, and is said to contain about seven
acres of land; such, however, is the effect of the
vast extent of horizon, and the expanded tract
of water which rolls around its base, that its
real magnitude is apparently lost.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p>In a mineralogical point of view, this eminence
is certainly the most interesting in Cornwall, or
perhaps in England; who can believe that this
little spot has occasioned greater controversy,
and more <i>ink</i>-shed than any mountain in the
globe? yet such is the fact; let us therefore before
we ascend walk around its base and examine
the geological structure which has excited so
much attention. The scenery too is here of the
most magnificent description; rocks overhang
rocks in ruinous grandeur, and appear so fearfully
equipoised, that, although secure in their
immensity, they create in the mind the most
awful apprehension of their instability, whilst
the mighty roar of the ocean beneath, unites in
effect with the scenery above.&mdash;All around is
sublime.&mdash;&mdash;But the Geology, enough of the
picturesque.</p>

<p>The body of the rock is composed of <i>Slate</i> and
<i>Granite</i>; the whole northern base consists of the
former, but no where does it extend to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
height, the upper part, in every direction, consisting
of <i>Granite</i>. On the south side this <i>Granite</i>
descends to the water's edge, and it continues to
constitute the whole of the hill, both on the eastern
and western side, for about three-fourths of
its whole extent. Where the granite terminates
numerous veins of it appear in the slate, in many
different directions; while the granite in its turn,
encloses patches of slate. In the vicinity of the
former rock the latter is found to contain so
much <i>Mica</i>, as to resemble <i>Micaceous Schist</i>, or
fine grained <i>Gneiss</i>, for which it has been erroneously
taken by some of our earlier observers.
And, while at some of these junctions there would
seem to be a mere apposition of the two rocks,
at others, the intermixture is so complete as to
render it difficult to say to which of the two certain
considerable masses belong.</p>

<p>Here then is the phenomenon which has invested
the spot with so much geological interest.
Here is <i>Granite</i>, which <i>Werner</i> conceived to be a
primary formation, and around which he supposed
all other rocks to have been deposited, if
not of a later date, at least contemporaneous, in
origin, with slate. How is this anomaly to be
explained? <i>De Luc</i> at once asserts what we
presume no rational observer can for one moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
believe, that the rock of which these veins are
composed is <i>not</i> true Granite, but "<i>Pseudo-granite</i>"!
<i>Dr. Berger</i> attempts to surmount the
difficulty by a different expedient, and declares
that <i>they are not veins!</i> but prominences from the
granite beneath, which have been filled up by
the subsequent deposition of clay-slate. It might,
says <i>Sir H. Davy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> with nearly as much reason
be stated, that the veins of copper and tin belong
to a great interior metallic mass, and that they
existed prior to the rocks in which they are
found. The advocates of the Plutonian theory
have, as might have been supposed, eagerly
availed themselves of the support which this
phenomenon is so well calculated to afford their
favourite doctrine. They accordingly affirm that
the granite has been raised up through the incumbent
slate, into whose fissures it has insinuated
itself. Upon these theories we shall offer
no comment; it is the humble task of a "Guide"
merely to direct the attention of the traveller to
the phenomena themselves, and then to leave
him to deduce his own conclusions from their
appearance. In the fulfilment of this duty we
recommend the geologist to proceed to the western
base of the Mount, where he will find near
the water's edge, what have been considered by
<i>Dr. Thomson</i> as "two large beds of granite in
the slate, with veins running off from them; the
position and appearance of which are such as to
leave no doubt but that the great body of the
granite has been deposited posterior to the slate
formation." <i>Mr. Carne</i>, on the other hand, contends
that "these granitic bodies cannot with
any propriety be called '<i>Beds in the Slate</i>;' one
of them," says he, "is a granite vein, and although
six feet wide near the granite mass, it
becomes gradually smaller as it recedes, and
dwindles to a point at the distance of 80 feet.
The other is a part of the granitic mass, from
which some veins appear to diverge; and, in <i>no
part</i> does it overlie the slate."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole body of the Granite of the Mount
is traversed by an uninterrupted series of quartz
veins, which run parallel to each other with
wonderful regularity. They are very nearly vertical,
and their direction is east and west. On
the north-east side of the Mount many of them
can be traced into the incumbent slate; a circumstance
which strongly supports the idea of
the cotemporaneous origin of these two rocks.
In the investigation of these veins the Mineralogist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
may pass many an hour with satisfaction, we
shall therefore point out some of the more leading
phenomena which deserve his attention. <i>De
Luc</i> observed that "that part of the vein termed
in Cornwall the <i>Capel</i>, and on the Continent
<i>Selebanque</i>, and which is the first stratum adherent
to the sides of the fissures, changes as it
passes through different kinds of strata, sometimes
consisting of white <i>Quartz</i>, sometimes of
<i>Mica</i>." <i>Dr. Forbes</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> says, that "occasionally,
though rarely, the line of division between the
vein and the rock is tolerably distinct; frequently,
however, there is rather an insensible gradation
of the matter of the one into that of the
other, than an obvious apposition of surfaces."
The exterior parts of the veins consist of a bluish
<i>quartz</i>, very compact, and uniformly containing a
great deal of <i>Schorl</i>. This <i>schorlaceous</i> character
is much more distinct towards the sides or walls
of the veins, their centre being generally pure
<i>quartz</i>; and, commonly, crystallized. In most of
the veins there is a central line, or fissure, which
divides them into two portions; this is formed
by the close apposition and occasional union of
two crystallized, or, as they may be called, <i>drusy</i>
surfaces.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>Since Veins must be considered as having once
been the most active laboratories of Nature, so
may they now be regarded as her most valuable
cabinets of mineralogy. In those of Saint
Michael's Mount may be found crystals of <i>Apatite</i>,
from a very light to a very dark green colour,
and exhibiting most of the modifications of form<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
which are common to that mineral; <i>Oxide of
Tin</i>; <i>Felspar</i>; <i>Mica</i> beautifully crystallized in
tables; <i>Topaz</i> in small whitish or greenish crystals,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
both translucent and opaque, and which
are extremely numerous, many hundred being
observable on the face of some small blocks of
granite that have fallen from the precipices.</p>

<p><i>Pinite</i> has been said to have been also discovered
in this spot. Besides which may be found
that rare mineral, the <i>Triple Sulphuret of Copper,</i>
<i>Antimony, and Lead</i>; <i>Sulphuret of Tin</i>;
<i>Malachite</i>; <i>Fluor Spar</i>; and <i>Wolfram</i>. The
occurrence of this latter mineral was, we believe,
first noticed in the earlier edition of the present
work, and is important in as far as its presence
is generally supposed to afford decisive evidence
of the primitive formation of the mountain masses
in which it occurs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>This spot also presents us with several lodes
of <i>Tin</i> and <i>Copper</i>; the latter may be traced for
a considerable distance from the eastern to the
southern base of the hill. The <i>lode</i> of Tin was
formerly worked at the Mount, and a considerable
quantity of ore obtained; any farther excavation,
however, threatened to injure the foundations of
the castle, and it was therefore prudently abandoned.</p>

<p>The remains of the Mine may be seen on the
south side of the hill, and should be visited by
the mineralogist, who will find in the <i>Drift</i>,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> <i>Tin
crystals</i> and <i>Carbonate of Copper</i>, besides some
other minerals. Veins of Lead are also discoverable
in the rocks. <i>Mr. Carne</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> has lately directed
the attention of the mineralogist to the <i>veins</i> of
<i>Mica</i>, which have hitherto only been found in
the granite of this singular spot. They are seldom
more than half an inch wide; and, although
tolerably straight, are very short. They generally
consist of two layers of Mica in plates,
which meet in the centre of the veins. Some of
the masses of <i>Granite</i> which constitute the summit
of the Mount have the appearance of an old
wall retaining, in parts, a coating of plaster; this
is the effect of decomposition, and of the <i>capel</i>
having in many places remained attached to the
face of the rock, after the vein itself has crumbled
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The Botanist will also find some amusement
among the rocks; he will observe the Tamarisk,
(<i>Tamarix Gallica</i>) growing in their crevices, and
relieving by a delicate verdure the harsh uniformity
of their surfaces. This shrub was probably
imported from Normandy by the Monks. <i>Asplenium
Marinum</i> and <i>Inula Helenium</i> are also to
be seen among the rocks&mdash;but let us leave the
Botanist and Mineralogist to their researches,
while we climb the hill and examine the venerable
building on its summit.</p>

<p>We ascend on the north-eastern side, by a
rocky winding path, in the course of which,
several remains of its ancient fortifications present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
themselves; thus, about the middle of the
hill, there is a curtain, parallel to, and flanking
the approach, at whose western end is a ravelin,
through which every one is to pass, walled with
three embrasures, and at the angle in the eastern
shoulder is a centry box to guard the passage,
and there was formerly also an iron gate; after
having passed this ruin, we turn to our left, and
ascend by a flight of broken steps to the door of
the castle, whose appearance is much more monastic
than martial. The most ancient parts of
the building are the Entrance, with the Guardroom
on the left hand; the Chapel, and the former
Refectory, or common hall of the Monks.
The other parts are of a modern date, although
the style of their architecture confers upon them
a corresponding air of antiquity.</p>

<p>The Refectory, or Common Hall, from the
frieze, with which it is ornamented, appears to
have been fitted up, since the reformation, as a
dining room for a hunting party, and is popularly
denominated "<i>The Chevy-Chace Room</i>." The
cornice represents in stucco, the modes of hunting
the wild boar, bull, stag, ostrich, hare, fox, and
rabbit. At the upper end of this room are the
royal arms, with the date 1644; and, at the opposite
end, those of the St. Aubyn family. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
room is 33 feet long, 16 wide, and 18 high, and
has a solemn and imposing appearance, which is
not a little heightened by the antique and appropriate
character of its furniture and ornaments.</p>

<p>The Chapel exhibits a venerable monument of
Saxon architecture; its interior has lately been
renewed in a chaste style of elegance, and a
magnificent organ has been erected. During
these repairs, in levelling a platform for the
altar, under the eastern window, a low gothic
door was discovered to have been closed up with
stone in the southern wall, and then concealed
with the raised platform; when the enclosure
was broken through, ten steps appeared descending
into a stone vault under the church, about
nine feet long, six or seven broad, and nearly as
many high. In this room was found the skeleton
of a very large man, without any remains of a
coffin. The discovery, of course, gave rise to
many conjectures, but it seems most probable,
that the man had been there immured for some
crime. The bones were removed and buried in
the body of the chapel. At the same time upon
raising the old pavement, the fragment of an
inscribed sepulchral stone of some Prior was
taken up; there was also a grave stone, not inscribed,
which Antiquaries have supposed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
covered the remains of <i>Sir John Arundel</i>, of
Trerice, Knight, who was slain on the strand
below, in the wars of York and Lancaster. In
the tower of this chapel are six sweet toned bells,
which frequently ring when <i>Sir John St. Aubyn</i>
is resident; at this time also choral service is
performed; and, on a calm day, the undulating
sound of the bells, and the swelling note of the
organ, as heard on the water, produce an effect
which it is impossible to describe.</p>

<p>From the chapel, we may ascend by a narrow
stone stair-case to the top of the tower. The
prospect hence is of the grandest description,
and is perhaps as striking as any that can occur
to "<i>mortal eye</i>." "The immense extent of sea,"
says <i>Dr. Maton</i>, "raises the most sublime emotions,
the waves of the British, Irish, and Atlantic
seas all roll within the compass of the sight,"
whilst the eye is relieved from the uniform,
though imposing grandeur of so boundless an
horizon, by wandering on the north and west,
over a landscape, which Claude himself might
have transfused on his canvas.</p>

<p>On one of the angles of this tower is to be seen
the carcase of a stone lantern, in which, during
the fishing season, and in dark tempestuous nights,
it may reasonably be supposed that the monks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to whom the tithe of such fishery belonged, kept
a light, as a guide to sailors, and a safeguard to
their own property; this lantern is now vulgarly
denominated <i>Saint Michael's Chair</i>, since it will
just admit one person to sit down in it; the attempt
is not without danger, for the chair, elevated
above the battlements, projects so far over
the precipice, that the climber must actually turn
the whole body at that altitude, in order to take
a seat in it; notwithstanding the danger, however,
it is often attempted; indeed one of the
first questions generally put to a stranger, if
married, after he has visited the Mount,&mdash;did
you sit in the chair?&mdash;for there is a conceit that,
if a married woman has sufficient resolution to
place herself in it, it will at once invest her with
all the regalia of petticoat government; and that
if a married man sit in it, he will thereby receive
ample powers for the management of his wife.
This is probably a remnant of monkish fable, a
supposed virtue conferred by some saint, perhaps
a legacy of St. Keyne, for the same virtue is attributed
to her well.</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>On the north-eastern side of the fabric are
situated the modern apartments. They were
erected by the late Sir <i>John St. Aubyn</i> upon the
ruins of the ancient convent, in clearing away
which, cart loads of human bones were dug up,
and interred elsewhere, the remains probably
both of the nuns and of the garrison. All that
deserves notice in this part are two handsome
rooms leading into each other, from which the
prospect is of the most extensive description. In
the first parlour, placed in niches, are two large
vases, with an alto relief of statuary marble in
each, relating to Hymeneal happiness.</p>

<p>Let us now take a review of the various interesting
events, which the traditionary lore of past
ages represents as having occurred at this spot,
and first of the natural history of the Hill itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Natural History.</span>&mdash;The rock of the
Mount has worn the same aspect for ages; tradition
however whispers, that at a remote period
it presented a very different appearance,&mdash;that it
was cloathed with wood, and at a considerable
distance from the sea! Its old Cornish name,
"<i>Carreg Lug en Kug</i>," that is, <i>the hoary rock
in the wood</i>, would seem to add some probability
to the tradition. It appears also from the original
charter of the Confessor, that the Mount was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in his time only <i>nigh</i> the sea, for he describes it
expressly as Saint Michael <i>near</i> the sea, "Sanctum
Michaelum qui est <i>juxta</i> mare." What this
distance was the charter does not inform us, but
the words of Worcester, who gained his information
from the legend of Saint Michael, are sufficiently
decisive, "<i>this place was originally inclosed
within a very thick wood, distant from the
ocean six miles, affording the finest shelter to wild
beasts.</i>" With respect to the period and causes
of the catastrophe which have changed the face
of this country, we have already offered some
observations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ecclesiastical History.</span>&mdash;The Mount appears
to have been consecrated by superstition
from the earliest period; and, according to monkish
legends, from the supposed appearance of the
archangel Saint Michael to some hermits, upon
one of its craggy points. Tradition has not preserved
the place where the vision appeared, but
antiquarianism has attempted to supply the deficiency
by conjecture; the spot was denominated
"<i>Saint Michael's Chair</i>," and is said to be one
of the large rocks overhanging the battery, an
appellation which has been erroneously transferred
to the carcase of a stone lantern, situated,
as we have just stated, on the tower of the chapel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Our poet Milton alludes to this vision in the following
passage of his Lycidas&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Or whether thou to our moist views deny'd<br />
"Sleeps't by the fable of Bellerus old<br />
"<i>Where the great vision of the guarded mount</i><br />
"Looks towards Namancos and Bayonas hold.<br />
"Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth,<br />
"And O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth."<br />
</div>

<p>Spencer also makes mention of this spot in a
manner which proves that it was universally hallowed
by the devout.</p>

<div class="poem">
"In evil hour thou lenst in hond<br />
"Thus holy hills to blame,<br />
"For sacred unto Saints they stond,<br />
"And of them han their name,<br />
"St. Michael's Mount who does not know<br />
"That wards the western coast."<br />
</div>

<p>Very little is known with respect to the ecclesiastical
history of the Mount, previous to its
endowment by Edward the Confessor. From
what may be collected, however, from expiring
tradition, it would appear that so early as the
end of the fifth century, Saint Keyne, a holy virgin
of the blood royal, daughter of Breganus
Prince of Brecknockshire, with her cockle hat
and staff, performed a pilgrimage to Saint Michael's
Mount: now it is fair to conclude that it
was before this time a place universally hallowed,
or a person of Saint Keyne's rank would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
paid it such a visit; thus then was it renowned
for its sanctity for at least five hundred years
before the grant and settlement of it by the
Confessor; before this period, however, it was
probably little more than an hermitage, or oratory,
with the necessary reception for pilgrims.</p>

<p>The Confessor found monks here serving God,
and gave them by charter the property of the
Mount together with "all the land of <i>Vennefire</i>
(a district probably in Cornwall), with the towns,
houses, fields, meadows, land cultivated, and
uncultivated, with their rents; together with a
port called <i>Ruminella</i> (Romney in Kent), with
all things that appertain, as mills and fisheries,"
first obliging them to conform the rule of the
order of Saint Benedict.</p>

<p>The peculiar respect in which this church was
held may be estimated from an instrument recorded
by William of Worcester, and asserted to
have been found amongst its ancient registers.</p>

<p>"To all members of Holy Mother Church, who
shall read or hear these letters, Peace and Salvation.
Be it known unto you all, that our
Most Holy Lord Pope Gregory, in the year of
Christ's Incarnation, 1070, out of his great zeal
and devotion to the church of Mount Saint
Michal, in Tumba, in the county of Cornwall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
hath piously granted to the aforesaid church,
which is entrusted to the Angelical Ministry,
and with full approbation, consecrated and
sanctified, to remit to all the <i>faithful</i>, who shall
<i>enrich</i>, <i>endow</i>, or <i>visit</i> the said church, a <i>third
part</i> of their <i>Penance</i>, and that this grant may
remain for ever unshaken and inviolable, by
the authority of God the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, he forbids all his
Successors from attempting to make any alteration
against this Decree."</p>

<p>We learn from the same author, that in order
to encrease, as much as possible, the influx of
votaries to the shrine, the above decree was
placed publicly on the gates of the church, and
enjoined to be read in other churches.</p>

<p>When the Normans came in, Robert Earl of
Morton and Cornwall became the patron of this
religious house, erected buildings, and gave some
lands, but from a superior affection for Normandy,
he abridged its liberties, and annexed it
to the monastery of <i>Saint Michael de periculo
Maris</i>, on the coast of Normandy, to which situation
the Mount is said to bear a striking resemblance;
from this time, it became only a cell
dependant upon, and subordinate to that foreign
priory. As these Monks were of the reformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
order of Benedictines, and of the Gilbertine kind,
a nunnery was allowed in their vicinity; this
they would make us believe was done with no
other view, than to shew the triumph of faith
over the impulse of sense, but it certainly must
be confessed, to speak even most charitably of it,
that such an union amid the sequestration of solitude,
carries a strange appearance with it to our
protestant suspiciousness. The remains of this
convent, we have already said, were removed by
the late proprietor, and the <i>New Buildings</i>, as
they are called, erected on their site; from the
appearance of the carved fragments of stone, and
other marks of architectural distinction, found
among the ruins, the Nunnery appears to have
been by far the most costly and magnificent part
of the edifice, the result we presume of <i>Monkish
gallantry</i>. Its establishment appears to have terminated
at the time Pomeroy surprised it, (an
account of which transaction is recorded under
the military history,) but the Priory continued a
cell to Saint Michael's in Normandy, until that
connection was destroyed, and all the alien priories
were seized in the reign of Edward the
Third.</p>

<p>Henry the Sixth granted this Priory to King's
College, Cambridge, but it was afterwards transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
by Edward the Fourth to the nunnery of
Sion, Middlesex; and so it continued until the
general dissolution; at which period its revenues
were valued at £110:12s. per annum, a considerable
sum at that time, especially as the number
of Monks maintained on the foundation never
exceeded six; this sum, together with the government
of the Mount, which was then a military
post, was bestowed on Hugh Arundel, who was
executed for rebellion in the year 1548. On his
death it was demised to John Milliton of Pengersick,
Esq., to William his son, and further to
William Harris, Esq. of Hayne in Devonshire,
connected by marriage with the family of Milliton.
Queen Elizabeth, by Letters Patent, in the
29th year of her reign, demised it to Arthur
Harris<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of Kenegie, Esq. a younger son of the
above William Harris, for life. It is in the
Patent (which recites the former grants to the
Millitons) described as in the note<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> below. Arthur
Harris was about this time appointed Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the Mount, and held that appointment until
his decease in 1628. It was then granted, it is
supposed, in trust for the Earl of Salisbury, from
whom it passed to Francis Bassett, Esq. who
being imprisoned by the usurping powers in the
reign of Charles the First, was obliged in order
to purchase his liberty to part with it to John St.
Aubyn, Esq. in whose family it now remains.
The present Baronet seldom visits it, a circumstance
universally regretted, for no gentleman
better understands how to grace the venerable
seat with Knightly dignity and splendor: Sir
John too is a zealous mineralogist, and might by
his presence in Cornwall contribute essentially
to the progress of that science; in one respect
his absence is fortunately supplied by the vigilance
of his agents, and every geologist ought to
feel obliged to them, we allude to the care with
which they protect the picturesque and mineralogical
beauties of the rocks by opposing the
sacrilegious removal of any part of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Military History.</span>&mdash;From the time of King
Edward the Confessor, to the middle of the reign
of Richard the First, the Mount appears to have
been exclusively the sacred nursery of religion;
the earliest transaction of a military nature was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
during the captivity of Richard the First, in Germany,
when Henry de la Pomeroy, of Berry
Pomeroy in Devonshire, having stabbed a serjeant
at arms who came to summon him to appear
for a heavy crime, fled into Cornwall, and cast
himself upon the protection of John, Earl of
that province, who readily supplied him with an
armed force, for he was then aspiring to his brother's
throne; with this, Pomeroy went in disguise
to the Mount, and under a pretence of
visiting his sister, who was in the nunnery, gained
admission, and treacherously reduced it to the
service of the said John; upon the return however
of the King from imprisonment, he surrendered
the garrison on mercy, although, despairing
himself of pardon, he soon died, or as some say,
caused himself to be bled to death; after this
event, the Prior and the Monks were restored to
the full possession of their cells, revenues, and
chapel; a small garrison however was still maintained,
to defend it against the sudden invasion
of enemies, and in this condition, "manned out
with carnal and spiritual soldiers," did the Mount
remain for a space of 275 years, when another
military transaction occurred to disturb its repose.
After the defeat of the Lancastrians at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Barnet, in the eighteenth year of Edward the
Fourth, John Vere, Earl of Oxford, one of the
most zealous partisans, fled from the field, set
sail for Saint Michael's Mount, and having disguised
himself, together with a few attendants,
in the habits of pilgrims, obtained entrance, massacred
the unsuspecting garrison, and seized the
fortress, which he valiantly defended for some
time against the forces of Edward, but was at
length compelled to surrender. Sir John Arundel
de Trerice, Sheriff of Cornwall, at the command
of the King, marched thither with <i>posse comitatus</i>
to besiege it, but he fell a victim on the sands,
at its base, and lies buried in the chapel.</p>

<p>In King Henry the Seventh's reign, the Lady
Catherine Gordon, wife of Perkin Warbeck, the
pretended son of Edward the Fourth, remained
here for safety, but after the flight of her husband,
she was taken prisoner by Giles, Lord
Banbury, and carried before that King.</p>

<p>During the Cornish commotion in the reign of
Edward the Sixth, many of the superior families
fled to the Mount for security, and were besieged
by the rebels, who took the plain at the bottom
of the rock by assault, at the time of low water,
and afterwards the summit, by carrying great
trusses of hay before them to obstruct the defendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sight, and deaden their shot. This situation,
together with the fears of the women, and
the want of food, obliged the besieged to surrender.
During the civil contentions in the reign
of Charles the First, the fortifications of the
Mount were so much increased, that the works
were styled "<i>impregnable and almost inaccessible</i>."
The Parliament forces, however, under
the command of Colonel Hammond, reduced the
place, and liberated the Duke of Hamilton, who
was there confined; a service which the historians
of that period represent as full of danger
and difficulty, and this was the last military transaction
that occurred upon this romantic spot.
Several batteries were erected by government
during the late war, to command the western
part of the bay, the eastern being too shallow to
allow the entrance of large vessels.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude this account of the Mount
without observing, that several antiquarians have
considered it as the <i>Ictis</i> of Diodorus, whither
the Greek merchants traded for Cornish Tin;
the limits of this work will not allow us to enter
upon the discussion, but we beg to refer the
curious reader to an ingenious work, published
by <i>Sir Christopher Hawkins</i>,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and to <i>Dr. Maton's</i>
"Observations on the Western Counties." It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
curious, and satisfactory, that these gentlemen
should have arrived at the same conclusion upon
the subject, and by nearly the same train of reasoning,
without any previous communication with
each other.</p>

<h2>EXCURSION II.</h2>

<div class="center">
TO THE LAND's END.&mdash;LOGAN ROCK, &amp;c.<br /><br />
</div>

<div class="poem">
"The Sun beams tremble, and the purple light<br />
Illumes the dark Bolerium;&mdash;seat of storms,<br />
High are his granite rocks; his frowning brow<br />
Hangs o'er the smiling ocean. In his caves,<br />
Where sleep the haggard spirits of the storm,<br />
Wild dreary are the schistose rocks around,<br />
Encircled by the waves, where to the breeze<br />
The haggard cormorant shrieks; and far beyond<br />
Are seen the cloud-like islands, grey in mists."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sir H. Davy.</i>
</div>

<p>In an excursion to the <i>Land's End</i> the traveller
will meet with several intermediate objects
well worthy his attention, more worthy, perhaps,
than the celebrated promontory itself, as being
monuments of the highest antiquity in the kingdom.
They consist of <i>Druidical circles</i>, <i>Cairns</i>,
or circular heaps of stones, <i>Cromlechs</i>, <i>Crosses</i>,
<i>Military Entrenchments</i>, and the obscure remains
of <i>Castles</i>. Many of these venerable objects,
however, to the eternal disgrace of the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
be it spoken, have of late been much mutilated,
and indeed some have been entirely demolished.
That the noblest monuments of Greece
should have been converted into lime by the
barbarous Turks, or that the temple of Diana
should have furnished a cement for the voluptuous
apartments of the Haram, are instances of
degeneracy which we might have been prepared
to witness in such a people; but that the venerable
remains of British antiquity, the silent but
faithful monuments of men and days long past,
which are so interesting from their connection
with the primitive history of our island, should
in this enlightened age have been sawed into gate
posts, or converted into pig-troughs, is really
past all endurance.&mdash;But to proceed.&mdash;In riding
from Penzance to the Land's End, which is about
ten miles distant, the first objects to be noticed
are two beautiful villas, well wooded, and adjoining
each other,&mdash;<i>Castle-Horneck</i>, the seat
of the Borlase family, and <i>Rose Hill</i>, the property
of the Rev. Uriah Tonkin. The sea and
land views from these houses are of the most
enchanting description. In viewing the latter
place, the stranger will scarcely believe that the
spot which now exhibits so rich a pastural scene,
was a few years since a deformed and barren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
rock! but what cannot gold effect, or where is
the wild which its magic cannot convert into
fairy land? The cost of the gunpowder alone
for blowing up the rocks to facilitate their removal
amounted to several hundred pounds.</p>

<p>About a mile farther west, the road passes
another villa, Trereiffe, the ancient seat of the
family of Nicholls, who have been proprietors of
the great tythes of the parish of Madron from the
period of the reformation. It is now the residence
of the Rev. Charles Valentine Le Grice,
into whose possession it has passed by marriage.
The scenery about this place is of a very exquisite
cast, and, from the richness of the land,
and luxuriance of its productions, it may be
fairly denominated the garden of the Mount's
Bay. After passing through a shady avenue,
from which we catch a delicious peep of the sea
bounded by a grotesque group of rocks, we take
leave of the picturesque, and plunge into a country
of a very different aspect and description,&mdash;rough,
wild, and unsheltered; never was contrast
more complete or striking, not a tree is seen to
break the extended uniformity of the hills, nor is
there a single object, with the exception of a few
scattered monuments of antiquity, to recommend
it to notice. The agriculturist may, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
view the district with somewhat different sensations,
for the downs are certainly improveable,
and those portions which have been brought into
tillage have amply rewarded the labour of the
adventurer: indeed in several districts cultivation
has even spread to the very brim of the ocean.</p>

<p>The natural product of the high lands is only a
thin turf interspersed with heath, fern and furze,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and many huge blocks of granite are disseminated
in all directions; this circumstance has materially
impeded the progress of cultivation, for in order
to remove these <i>boulders</i> it is necessary to blast
them with gunpowder; the fragments, however,
become useful in their turn, and are employed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
making enclosures, which bear the provincial
name of <i>hedges</i>. This stone, commonly called
<i>Growan</i>, is, moreover, wrought into columnar
masses, eight or ten feet long, which are used as
supporters to sheds and outhouses, or gates posts,
and bridges over rivulets. It is also the material
of which common rollers, mill-stones, salting and
pig troughs are made; in short, few stones are
converted to more various purposes of rural
&oelig;conomy, and it accordingly forms an article of
some commercial value. The mode of splitting it
into the required forms is somewhat curious; it
is effected by applying several wedges to holes
cut, or <i>pooled</i> as it is termed, in the surface of
the stone at the distance of three or four inches
from each other, according to its size and hardness;
the harder the mass, the easier it may be
split into the required form; the softer, the less
regularly it separates. The blocks of granite
employed in the construction of the Waterloo
Bridge over the Thames were procured from the
downs in the vicinity of Penhryn.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The Granite of the Land's End district is remarkable
for its coarse grain, and the large proportion
of its felspar, which, according to the
observations of <i>Dr. Paris</i>, may be estimated as
high as from 70 to 90 per cent. It moreover possesses
an earthy texture, which greatly accelerates
its decomposition. This circumstance will in
some measure account for the unusual fertility of
the <i>growan</i> soil in the parishes of Saint Burian,
Sennen, and Saint Levan. It will moreover
explain the theory of a practice, which would
otherwise appear absurd, that of actually applying
the disintegrated <i>growan</i> to certain lands as
a manure!</p>

<p>On a closer examination of this Granite, the
prismatic crystals of felspar will often be found
to exhibit that structure which <i>Haüy</i> calls <i>hemitrope</i>;
more often, they are termed <i>macles</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
are compounded of two crystals intersecting each
other at particular angles.</p>

<p>The Botanist as he rides along in the Summer
months will observe amongst the gorse (<i>Ulex</i>),
which is abundant on each side of the road, the
parasitical plant <i>Cuscuta Epithymum</i>, (called
<i>Epiphany</i> by the country people,) winding its
spiral structure in all directions, and producing
from its reddish hue a beautiful contrast.</p>

<p>The farming of this country is in general slovenly,
and certainly very far behind any other
part of the kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> although it is but just to
acknowledge that <i>Leha</i>, a farm situated near the
Land's End road, forms a pleasing exception to
this general remark. The proprietor, John
Scobell Esq. of Nancealverne, has here introduced
the <i>Drill Husbandry of Northumberland</i>,
which would seem to be well adapted to a country
so infested with weeds, those hungry invaders
of the farmer's property, and usurpers of his soil.
The farmers have a peculiar practice, obviously
suggested by the inconstancy of the weather, that
of putting up their wheat, barley, and other kinds
of grain, in the field into what are called "<i>Arishmows</i>."
The sheaves are built up into a regular
solid cone about twelve feet high; the beards all
turned inwards, and the butt end only exposed
to the weather. The whole is finished by an
inverted sheaf of reed or corn and tied to the
upper rows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>The first objects of antiquity which we have to
notice are the stone crosses placed by the roads'
side; some of them still retain their original
situation, while others, broken and mutilated,
have been converted into the various purposes of
rural &oelig;conomy. They appear to have been originally
designed as guides to direct the pilgrim
to the different churches. A few of the more
remarkable of them are represented as vignettes
in different parts of the present work, from which
the reader will become acquainted with their
general appearance.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Boscawen-Un</span>, in a field about a quarter
of a mile west of <i>Leha</i>, we meet with one of the
most ancient British monuments in the kingdom;
"<i>a Druidical circle</i>," as it has been pronounced,
consisting of nineteen stones, some of which have
fallen, placed in a circle of about twenty-five
feet in diameter, having a single one in the centre.
There is considerable doubt and obscurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
with respect to the origin and intended use of
these circles, of which there are many similar
examples in Cornwall. <i>Camden</i> is inclined to
consider them as military trophies, while <i>Borlase</i>
deems it highly probable that such monuments
were of religious institution, and designed originally
and principally for the rites of worship; at
the same time he conceives "they might sometimes
have been employed as places of council
and judgment, and that, whilst any council or
decree was pending, the principal persons concerned
stood, each by his pillar, and that where
a middle stone was erected, as at <i>Boscawen-Un</i>,
there stood the Prince or General elect." This
must certainly be acknowledged as one of the
most extraordinary specimens of antiquarian
dreaming ever presented to the public.</p>

<p>About half a mile to the right of the high
road stands an object of later origin, but not
of less interest to the antiquary; the ruins of a
small oratory, or baptistry, dedicated to <i>Saint
Euinus</i>, and commonly known by the name of
<i>Chapel Euny</i>. It is situated near a well, whose
waters have been long supposed to possess very
extraordinary virtues, and to have performed
many miraculous cures. There is a similar ruin,
which we shall hereafter have occasion to notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
at Madron; and it is worthy of remark that
these wells do not possess any mineral impregnation;
the sick, however, at this very day, repair
to them, while the credulous attempt to read the
future in the appearance of the bubbles produced
in their waters by the dropping in of pins or
pebbles. This mode of divining is perhaps one
of the most ancient superstitions that have descended
to us, and was termed <i>Hydromancy</i>.
The Castalian fountain, and many others amongst
the Grecians, were supposed to be of a prophetic
nature; thus, by dipping a fair mirror into a well
did the Patræans of Greece receive, as they vainly
imagined, some notice of ensuing sickness, or
convalescence.</p>

<p>On the summit of the hill above these ruins,
are situated the remains of <i>Caerbran Castle</i> or
Round (that is <i>Brennus's Castle</i>) which is thus
described by <i>Borlase</i>. "It is a circular fortification,
consisting first of a deep ditch, fifteen
feet wide, edged with stone, through which you
pass to the outer <i>vallum</i>, which is of earth, fifteen
feet high, and was well perfected towards the
north-east, but not so towards the west; within
this vallum, passing a large ditch about fifteen
yards wide, you come to a stone wall, which
quite rounded the top of the hill, and seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
have been of considerable strength, but lies,
now, like a ridge of disorderly stones; the diameter
of the whole is ninety paces, and in the
centre of all is a little circle."</p>

<p>There are no less than seven of these <i>hill castles</i>,
as they are termed, although they might
with more propriety be called strong entrenchments,
to be seen at this time within five miles
around Penzance; all so placed on the hills as
to admit of immediate communication with each
other by signal. From several of them we have
views of the North and South Channel, but from
all of them either that of one sea or the other.
Much doubt has arisen concerning their origin.
<i>Mr. Polwhele</i> attributes them to the Irish, while
<i>Dr. Borlase</i>, like an orthodox antiquary, who
takes shelter, whenever he is bewildered, under
the sanction of a popular name, at once boldly
decides upon their Danish origin.</p>

<p>The lonely ruins of <i>Chapel Carn Bre</i> next
attract our notice; they are situated upon the
extremity of a high granite ridge, overlooking
the surfy recess of <i>Whitsand Bay</i>; from their
great elevation they are visible from every part
of the country, although they scarcely form a
skeleton of the original building, and in a short
time, probably, not a vestige will remain to mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the consecrated spot. It appears to have been a
Chantry, erected for the performance of religious
service for the safety of mariners. It is not for
the inspection of these ruins that we direct the
stranger to ascend the hill, for they are too insignificant
to merit attention, but it is for the
purpose of his viewing the extensive prospect
which its summit commands,&mdash;a wild expanse of
waters occupying twenty-nine points of the compass!&mdash;From
this spot also Saint Michael's Mount
has a singularly fine effect, appearing as if placed
in the centre of a lake at a distance from the
ocean.</p>

<p>We now proceed to <i>Sennan Church-town</i>,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
which according to barometrical admeasurement
is 391 feet above the level of the sea. It is about
a mile from the <i>Land's End</i>, and is celebrated
for containing the Ale-house whimsically called
"<i>The First and Last Inn in England</i>." On the
western side of its sign is inscribed "<i>The First</i>,"
and on the eastern side "<i>The Last Inn in England</i>."</p>

<p>The last village towards the Land's End is
named <i>Mayon</i> or <i>Mean</i>. In this place is the
large stone spoken of by Dr. Borlase under the
name of "<i>Table mean</i>," and concerning which
there is a vague tradition that three kings once
dined together on it, in their journey to the
Land's End.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>On the turf between this village and the Land's
End, the Botanist will find <i>Bartsia Viscosa</i>, and
<i>Illocebrum Verticillatum</i>, the latter of which is
peculiar to this county.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the celebrated Promontory,
we descend a rapid slope, which brings us to a
bold group of rocks, composing the western extremity
of our island. Some years ago a military
officer who visited this spot, was rash enough to
descend on horseback; the horse soon became
unruly, plunged, reared, and, fearful to relate,
fell backwards over the precipice, and rolling
from rock to rock was dashed to atoms before it
reached the sea. The rider was for some time
unable to disengage himself, but at length by a
desperate effort he threw himself off, and was
happily caught by some fragments of rock, at
the very brink of the precipice, where he remained
suspended in a state of insensibility until
assistance could be afforded him! The awful
spot is marked by the figure of a horse-shoe,
traced on the turf with a deep incision, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
cleared out from time to time, in order to preserve
it as a monument of rashness which could
be alone equalled by the good fortune with which
it was attended.</p>

<p>Why any promontory in an island should be
exclusively denominated the Land's <i>End</i>, it is
difficult to understand; yet so powerful is the
charm of a name, that many persons have visited
it on no other account; the intelligent tourist,
however, will receive a much more substantial
gratification from his visit; the great geological
interest of the spot will afford him an ample
source of entertainment and instruction, while
the magnificence of its convulsed scenery, the
ceaseless roar, and deep intonation of the ocean,
and the wild shrieks of the Cormorant, all combine
to awaken the blended sensations of awe
and admiration.</p>

<p>The cliff which bounds this extremity is rather
abrupt than elevated, not being more than sixty
feet above the level of the sea. It is composed
entirely of Granite, the forms of which present a
very extraordinary appearance, assuming in some
places the resemblance of <i>shafts</i> that had been
regularly cut with the chisel; in others, regular
equidistant fissures divide the rock into horizontal
masses, and give it the character of basaltic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
columns; in other places, again, the impetuous
waves of the ocean have opened, for their retreat,
gigantic arches, through which the angry billows
roll and bellow with tremendous fury.</p>

<p>Several of these rocks from their grotesque
forms have acquired whimsical appellations, as
that of the <i>Armed Knight</i>, the <i>Irish Lady</i>, &amp;c.
An inclining rock on the side of a craggy headland,
south of the Land's End, has obtained the
name of <i>Dr. Johnson's Head</i>, and visitors after
having heard the appellation seldom fail to acknowledge
that it bears some resemblance to the
physiognomy of that extraordinary man.</p>

<p>On the north, this rocky scene is terminated
by a promontory 229 feet above the level of the
sea, called "<i>Cape Cornwall</i>," between which and
the Land's End, the coast retires, and forms
<i>Whitsand Bay</i>, a name which it derives from,
the peculiar whiteness of its sand, and amongst
which the naturalist will find several rare microscopic
shells. There are, besides, some historical
recollections which invest this spot with interest.
It was in this bay that Stephen landed on his first
arrival in England; as did king John, on his return
from Ireland; and Perkin Warbeck, in the
prosecution of those claims to the crown to which
some late writers have been disposed to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that he was entitled, as the real son of Edward
the Fourth. In the rocks near the southern termination
of <i>Whitsand Bay</i> may be seen the junction
of the granite and slate; large veins of the
former may be also observed to traverse the
latter in all directions.</p>

<p>In viewing the whole of the scenery of this
stern coast "it is impossible" says De Luc, "not
to be struck with the idea, that <i>the bed of the sea
is the effect of a vast subsidence</i>, in which the strata
were broken off on the edge of what, by the retreat
of the sea towards the sunken part, became
a <i>continent</i>; the many small islands, or rocks of
granite, appear to be the memorials of the land's
abridgement, being evidently parts of the sunken
strata remaining more elevated than the rest."
There is a small <i>Archipelago</i> of this kind called
the <i>Long-ships</i>, at the distance of two miles west
of the Land's end; on the largest of these rocks
is a light-house, which was erected in consequence
of the very dangerous character of the
coast, by a Mr. Smith, in the year 1797, who obtained
a grant from the Trinity House, and was
rewarded for a limited number of years by a certain
rate on all ships that passed it. This period
having expired, it is at present under the jurisdiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of the Trinity House.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The tower is constructed
of granite, the stones of which are <i>trenailed</i>
on the same plan as that adopted by Smeaton
in the construction of the Eddystone light-house.
The circumference of the tower at its
base is 68 feet; the height from the rock to the
vane of the lantern, 52 feet; and from the sea to
the base of the light-house it is 60 feet; but notwithstanding
this elevation its lantern has been
often dashed to pieces by the spray of the ocean
during the winter's tempest! The management
of this establishment is entrusted to two men,
who during the winter are often, for two or three
months, confined to this sea-girt prison without
the possibility of communicating with the land;
they accordingly lay in a store of provisions, as
if they were about to embark for a long voyage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>We have already stated that the historians of
Cornwall, from Leland, Norden, and Carew,
downwards, have all recorded the ancient tradition
of a considerable portion of the Mount's
bay having been formerly woodland. They have
likewise handed down the concurrent tradition
relative to the supposed tract of land which once
connected the islands of Scilly with Cornwall.
This tract, to which we are told was given the
name of the <i>Lioness</i> ("<i>the Silurian Lyonois</i>,")
is said to have contained one hundred and forty
parish churches, all of which were swept away
by the resistless ocean! As to the Cornish word
<i>Lethowstow</i>, or <i>Lioness</i>, by which the sea between
Scilly and Cornwall is distinguished, we
may observe, that the appropriation of such a
term is sufficiently accounted for from the general
violence and turbulence of the sea, just as the
celebrated rock lying south of the channel between
the Land's end and Scilly retains the name
of the <i>Wolf</i>,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> from the howling of the waves
around it. Those who may wish for farther evidence
upon this subject may consult <i>Mr. Boase's</i>
excellent memoir "On the submersion of part of
the Mount's bay," published in the second volume
of the Transactions of the Geological Society of
Cornwall.</p>

<p>We shall in this place make a short digression,
in order to afford some account of the <i>Scilly
Islands</i>, which are situated in a cluster about
nine leagues, west by south, from the Land's
end, and are distinctly visible from it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Scilly Islands</span> were called by the
Greeks <i>Hesperides</i> and <i>Capiterides</i>, or the <i>Tin
Isles</i>, and by this name they are mentioned by
Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Solinus. They
must, however, have undergone some material
revolution since the age of these writers, for we
fail in every attempt to reconcile their present
state with the description which they have transmitted
to us; and what is very unaccountable,
not a vestige of any ancient mine can be discovered
in the islands, except in one part of
<i>Trescow</i>; and these remains are so limited, that
they rather give an idea of an attempt at discovery,
than of extensive and permanent mining.
We are strongly inclined to believe that
the Tin of those days came, in part at least, from
the opposite coast of Saint Just, but of this we
shall hereafter speak more fully. In the time of
Strabo we learn that the number of these Islands
did not exceed <i>ten</i>, whereas at present there are
upwards of <i>one hundred and forty</i>, but of which
the following only are inhabited, viz. <i>Saint
Mary's</i>,<i> Saint Agnes'</i>, <i>Saint Martin's</i>, <i>Trescow</i>,
<i>Bryer</i>, and <i>Sampson</i>. It is curious that the name
of the cluster should have been derived from one
of the smallest of the islets (Scilly), whose surface
does not exceed an acre. The number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
inhabitants amounts to about two thousand,
nearly half of which reside in Saint Mary's,
which contains 1600 acres; it possesses three
towns, a pier, a garrison, a custom house, and
some monuments of British antiquity.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Saint Agnes</span> is a very high and strong
light-house, which was erected in the year 1680.
Its present machinery was designed by the ingenious
Adam Walker, the well known lecturer on
Natural Philosophy, although it has lately undergone
some modification at the suggestion of
Mr. Wyatt. The machinery consists of a triangular
frame attached to a perpendicular axis,
which, by means of an appropriate power, is
made to revolve once every three minutes. On
each face of the triangle are arranged ten parabolic
reflectors of copper plated with silver, each
having an argand lamp in its focus. By this
device the light progressively sweeps the whole
horizon, and by its regular intermission and increase
is readily distinguished from every other
on the coast.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The civil government of these islands is chiefly
managed by twelve of the principal inhabitants,
who meet monthly at Heugh Town, St. Mary's,
and settle differences by compromise. The Duke
of Leeds holds the islands by lease for thirty-one
years from the year 1800, at the rent of £40,
besides paying the fine of £4000, as a renewal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>The reader is no doubt anxiously waiting to
be introduced to the classical descendants of the
Grecian or Ph&oelig;nician race,&mdash;Whether they have
been swallowed up with the "Lioness," or washed
into the ocean by the tempests, we know not;
but certain it is that the present inhabitants are
all new comers;&mdash;Ph&oelig;nician or Grecian, there
are none.&mdash;<i>Jenkins</i>, <i>Ellis</i>, <i>Hicks</i>, <i>Woodcock</i>,
<i>Ashford</i>, and <i>Gibson</i><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> are names which would
even defy the ingenious author of the Diversions
of Purley to trace to a classical source.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>The Scillonians are a robust and healthy people,
and were it not for the facility with which
they obtain spirits, they would attain a very advanced
age. It is a common saying amongst
them, and is no doubt intended to express how
highly favourable the spot is to longevity, although
it obviously admits of another construction,
that "<i>for one man who dies a natural death</i>,
<i>nine are drowned</i>." It has been remarked that a
deformed person is not to be found in the islands;
but we apprehend that this fact requires an explanation
very different from that which is usually
assigned; it cannot be received as any test
of the salubrity of the spot, or of the superior
healthiness of the race; the fact is simply this,
that exposure to inclement weather, want of
proper food, and those various privations which
necessarily increase as we recede from the luxuries
of civilization, kill, during infancy, those
feeble subjects which might, otherwise, have
become deformed during the progress of their
growth. It is for the same reason that we so
frequently observe the troops of barbarous countries
composed of the most athletic individuals, for
the hardship of their service weeds out the feeble
and invalid. We have already alluded to the
tenacity with which the Cornishman clings to his
native soil, but the attachment of the Scillonian,
if possible, is still stronger to his desolate rock.
What a striking contrast does this form with the
roving inhabitant of an alluvial country, where
every object, it might be presumed, was calculated
to excite and sustain the strongest attachment;
but this principle of Nature is wise and
universal,&mdash;the plant is easily loosened from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
generous soil, but with what difficulty is the
lichen torn from its rock.</p>

<p>The islanders are chiefly employed in Ashing,
making kelp from the <i>Algæ</i>, which is disposed of
to the Bristol merchant for the use of the glass
manufacturer, and in pilotage. From a combination,
however, of unfortunate circumstances, in
addition to the fatal blow given to the smuggling
trade, by the activity of the preventive service,
the inhabitants were reduced to such extreme
distress that it became necessary in the year 1819
to appeal to the generosity of the public in their
behalf; and, notwithstanding the great difficulties
of the times, the sum of nine thousand pounds
was collected for their relief. In this great work
of charity it is but an act of justice to state, that
the Society for promoting Christian knowledge,
by their purse, as well as by their writings, performed
a very essential service. The funds thus
obtained were in part appropriated to the relief
of the immediate and pressing distress under
which they laboured, while the remainder was
very judiciously applied towards the promotion of
such permanent advantages as might prevent the
chance of its recurrence. A Fish-cellar was
accordingly provided in the island of Trescow,
for the purpose of storing and curing Ash; boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
adapted for the Mackarel and Pilchard Fisheries
were purchased, and others were repaired; nets
and various kinds of tackling were also at the
same time liberally supplied. By such means
have the inhabitants of these cheerless rocks
been enabled to avail themselves of some of the
resources which Providence has placed within
their reach, and their families have been thus
enabled to exist without the dread of absolute
starvation.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Much, however, still remains for
philanthropic exertion, and should this humble
volume fall into the hands of those, who are
enabled by the superior gifts of fortune to
contribute to the wants of their unhappy brethren,
we may perhaps serve their cause by stating
that any donation, however small, will be
received by <i>Henry Boase, Esq.</i> at the Penzance
Bank. The greatest benefit would arise from the
extension of their fisheries, for in consequence of
the peculiar situation and convenience of these
islands, the Cod and Ling fisheries might be carried
to almost any extent; and, while boats in
any part even of the Mount's Bay, would be
weather-bound with the wind W.S.W. to S., they
can proceed from Scilly into the channel, without
the least difficulty. The Scillonians, however,
have as yet been unable to avail themselves of
the advantages of their locality; the want of proper
boats prevents their proceeding in the pursuit
of their occupation, farther than four or five
leagues from the land.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>During the summer months various species of
fish are caught with hook and line; among the
smaller kind, which are salted by the Scillonians
for their winter consumption, are "<i>Bass</i>, <i>Wrass</i>,
<i>Chad</i>, <i>Scad</i>, <i>Brit</i>, <i>Barne</i>, <i>Cuddle</i>, <i>Whistlers</i>," &amp;c.
all of which are included by the islanders under
the general appellation of "<i>Rock-fish</i>."</p>

<p>There is a very curious fact noticed here with
respect to the <i>Woodcock</i>. These birds generally
arrive in Scilly before they are observed in any
part of England; more frequently with a north-east,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
though sometimes with a north-west wind,
and are often so exhausted as to be caught in
great numbers by the inhabitants, especially near
the light-house, the splendour of whose light appears
to attract them, and striking against its
lantern they not unfrequently fall lifeless in the
gallery. It is for the naturalist to consider from
whence they migrate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<p>The Climate of these islands is both milder and
more equable than that of Cornwall, but this
advantage is counterbalanced by the frequent
occurrence of the most sudden and violent storms.
By those who have kept journals it has been
found that not more than six days of perfect calm
occur in the course of a year, and that the wind
blows from between S.W. and N.W. for more
than half of that period.</p>

<p>With respect to Geology, these islands will
afford but little variety; with the exception of
some beds of <i>Porphyry</i> at Saint Mary's, and
some beds of <i>Chlorite</i>, containing <i>Pyrites</i>, in the
same island, they consist entirely of Granite, and
are doubtless a continuation of the Devonian
range, although the rock assumes an appearance
less porphyritic; it contains, however, veins of
red Granite. At the Lizard Point in the island
of Trescow, a variety of granite occurs, in which
the felspar is of a remarkably pure white, and
might, we should conceive, be advantageously
employed in the manufacture of Porcelain. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
some chasms of this rock, and in the centre of
large masses, the <i>Mica</i> is of a silvery hue, and
occurs crystallized in its primitive form. In the
same island is a remarkable cavern, in the centre
of which is a pool of fresh water. The porphyritic
beds in Saint Mary's are interesting on
account of the distinct appearance of stratification
which they display, and <i>Mr. Majendie</i> thinks
that an undoubted instance of stratified granite
is to be seen near the same spot. The Granite
of Scilly is very liable to decomposition; whence
has arisen all that fancied statuary of the Druids,
of which we have spoken in another place. The
Islands are undoubtedly undergoing a gradual
diminution. At no great distance of time Saint
Mary's will probably be divided by the sea, and
a channel formed through the low land between
the New-town and the south-east side of the garrison.
This might perhaps be prevented by
throwing down masses of granite from a neighbouring
hill, so as to form a barrier against the
sea. The object may be worthy of attention, as
the sea in winter, with a high tide, has been
known to pass over this land, and the effect of its
forcing a channel there would be to divide the
garrison from the rest of the island. If the Geologist
proceeds to a spot behind the quay, and between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the front of the garrison-hill and that
island, he will be gratified by the discovery of a
process the very converse of that which we have
been just describing. In these places the granitic
sand is becoming indurated by the slow infiltration
of water holding iron in solution, and which
appears to be derived from the decomposing hills
above it. Some fine specimens of this "<i>regenerated</i>"
granite have been placed in the Geological
Society's cabinet at Penzance.</p>

<p>We now return to the Land's End,&mdash;from
which we should proceed to visit a promontory,
called "<i>Castle Treryn</i>," where is situated the
celebrated "<i>Logan Stone</i>." If we pursue our
route along the cliffs, it will be found to lie several
miles south-east of the Land's End, although
by taking the direct and usual road across the
country, it is not more than two miles distant;
but the Geologist must walk, or ride along the
coast on horseback, and we can assure him that
he will be amply recompensed for his trouble.</p>

<p>From the Cape on which the signal station is
situated, the rock scenery is particularly magnificent,
exhibiting an admirable specimen of the
manner, and forms, into which Granite disintegrates.
About forty yards from this Cape is the
promontory called <i>Tol-Pedn-Penwith</i>, which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the Cornish language signifies the <i>holed headland
in Penwith</i>. The name is derived from a singular
chasm, known by the appellation of the <i>Funnel
Rock</i>; it is a vast perpendicular excavation
in the granite, resembling in figure an inverted
cone, and has been evidently produced by the
gradual decomposition of one of those vertical
veins with which this part of the coast is so frequently
intersected. By a circuitous route you
may descend to the bottom of the cavern, into
which the sea flows at high water. Here the
Cornish Chough (<i>Corvus Graculus</i>) has built its
nest for several years, a bird which is very common
about the rocky parts of this coast, and may
be distinguished by its red legs and bill, and the
violaceous blackness of its feathers. This promontory
forms the Western extremity of the
Mount's Bay. The antiquary will discover in
this spot the vestiges of one of the ancient "<i>Cliff
Castles</i>," which were little else than stone walls,
stretching across necks of land from cliff to cliff.
The only geological phenomenon worthy of particular
notice is a large and beautiful contemporaneous
vein of <i>red Granite</i> containing <i>Shorl</i>; is
one foot in width, and may be seen for about
forty feet in length.</p>

<p>Continuing our route around the coast we at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
length arrive at "<i>Castle Treryn</i>." Its name is
derived from the supposition of its having been
the site of an ancient British fortress, of which
there are still some obscure traces, although the
wild and rugged appearance of the rocks indicate
nothing like art.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_103.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The foundation of the whole is a stupendous
group of Granite rocks, which rise in pyramidal
clusters to a prodigious altitude, and overhang
the sea. On one of those pyramids is situated
the celebrated "<i>Logan Stone</i>," which is an
immense block of Granite weighing above 60
tons. The surface in contact with the under
rock is of very small extent, and the whole mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
is so nicely balanced, that, notwithstanding its
magnitude, the strength of a single man applied
to its under edge is sufficient to change its centre
of gravity, and though at first in a degree scarcely
perceptible, yet the repetition of such impulses,
at each return of the stone, produces at length a
very sensible oscillation! As soon as the astonishment
which this phenomenon excites has in some
measure subsided, the stranger anxiously enquires
how, and whence the stone originated&mdash;was
it elevated by human means, or was it produced
by the agency of natural causes?&mdash;Those
who are in the habit of viewing mountain masses
with geological eyes, will readily discover that
the only chisel ever employed has been the tooth
of time&mdash;the only artist engaged, the elements.
Granite usually disintegrates into rhomboidal
and tabular masses, which by the farther operation
of air and moisture gradually lose their solid
angles, and approach the spheroidal form. <i>De
Luc</i> observed, in the Giant mountains of Silesia,
spheroids of this description so piled upon each
other as to resemble Dutch cheeses; and appearances,
no less illustrative of the phenomenon,
may be seen from the signal station to which we
have just alluded. The fact of the upper part
of the cliff being more exposed to atmospheric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
agency, than the parts beneath, will sufficiently
explain why these rounded masses so frequently
rest on blocks which still preserve the tabular
form; and since such spheroidal blocks must obviously
rest in that position in which their lesser
axes are perpendicular to the horizon, it is equally
evident that whenever an adequate force is applied
they must vibrate on their point of support.</p>

<p>Although we are thus led to deny the Druidical
<i>origin</i> of this stone, for which so many zealous
antiquaries have contended, still we by no means
intend to deny that the Druids employed it as an
engine of superstition; it is indeed very probable
that, having observed so uncommon a property,
they dexterously contrived to make it answer the
purposes of an ordeal, and by regarding it as
the <i>touchstone</i> of truth, acquitted or condemned
the accused by its motions. Mason poetically
alludes to this supposed property in the following
lines.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Behold yon huge</span><br />
And unknown sphere of living adamant,<br />
Which, pois'd by magic, rests its central weight<br />
On yonder pointed rock: firm as it seems,<br />
Such is its strange, and virtuous property,<br />
It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch<br />
Of him, whose heart is pure, but to a traitor,<br />
Tho' e'en a giant's prowess nerv'd his arm,<br />
It stands as fix'd as Snowdon."<br />
</div>

<p>The rocks are covered with a species of <i>Byssus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
long and rough to the touch, forming a kind of
hoary beard; in many places they are deeply
furrowed, carrying with them a singular air of
antiquity, which combines with the whole of the
romantic scenery to awaken in the minds of
the poet and enthusiast the recollection of the
Druidical ages. The Botanist will observe the
common Thrift (<i>Statice Armeria</i>) imparting a
glowing tinge to the scanty vegetation of the spot,
and, by growing within the crevices of the rocks,
affording a very picturesque contrast to their
massive fabric. Here too the <i>Daucus Maritimus</i>,
or wild carrot; <i>Sedum Telephium</i>, <i>Saxifraga
Stellaris</i>, and <i>Asplenium Marinum</i>, may be found
in abundance.</p>

<p>The Granite in this spot is extremely beautiful,
on account of its porphyritic appearance;
the crystals of felspar are numerous and distinct;
in some places the rock is traversed by veins of
red felspar, and of black tourmaline, or schorl,
of which the crystalline forms of the prisms, on
account of their close aggregation, are very indistinct.
Here may also be observed a contemporaneous
vein of <i>schorl rock</i> in the granite,
nearly two feet wide, highly inclined and very
short, and not having any distinct walls. On
the western side of the Logan rock is a cavern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
formed by the decomposition of a vein of granite,
the felspar of which assumes a brilliant flesh-red,
and lilac colour; and, where it is polished by
the sea, exceeding even in beauty the <i>Serpentine
caverns</i> at the Lizard.</p>

<p>Mr. Majendie observed in this spot numerous
veins of fine grained granite, which he is inclined
to consider as <i>cotemporaneous</i>; he also observed
what, at first sight, appeared to be fragments,
but which, upon closer examination, he pronounces
to be <i>cotemporaneous concretions</i>; for large
crystals of <i>felspar</i> may be seen shooting from the
porphyritic granite into these apparent fragments.
These phenomena are extremely interesting in a
geological point of view, and well deserve the
attention of the scientific tourist.</p>

<p>In Treryn cove, just below the site of the
castle, Dr. Maton found several of the rarer
species of shells, as <i>Patella Pellucida</i>, <i>P. Fissura</i>,
<i>Mytilus Modiolus</i>, <i>Trochus Conulus</i>, <i>Turbo Cimex</i>,
and <i>T. Fascitatus</i> (of Pennant.)</p>

<p>Before we quit this coast we beg to state, for
the information of the geological tourist, that the
<i>Granite</i> which we have just traced from beyond
the Land's End to this spot, continues until within
half a mile of the signal post near Lemorna
cove, where it meets with a patch of slate, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
lost for about the space of three quarters of a
mile. At the western extremity of this junction
(<i>Carn Silver</i>) the mineralogist will find embedded
Garnet-rock with veins of <i>Epidote</i> and
<i>Axinite</i>. Here may also be seen the rare occurrence
of a granite vein penetrating both the slate
and the granitic rock.</p>

<p>But let us return.&mdash;&mdash;About two miles north-east
of the Logan rock, and in the high road to
Penzance, stands the town of <span class="smcap">Saint Buryan</span>,
which though now only a group of wretched cottages
was once a place of very considerable note,
and the seat of a College of Augustine Canons;
the latter was founded by Athelstan after his
return from the conquest of the Scilly Islands,
A.D. 930. The remains of the College were wantonly
demolished by one Shrubshall, Governor
of Pendennis Castle, during the usurpation of
Cromwell.</p>

<p>The Church tower stands on the highest point
in this part of the country, being 467 feet above
the level of the sea; it consequently forms a very
conspicuous object, and is so exposed to the rains
from the Atlantic, that the stones carry a deceptive
face of freshness with them which lends an
aspect of newness to the whole building. From
the top of the tower the prospect is of a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
extensive kind, commanding the whole range of
the surrounding country, and an immense surface
of sea. In clear weather the Scilly Islands may
be easily distinguished in the horizon, especially
with a setting sun, when they appear to project
from the brilliant ground of the western sky like
figures embossed on burnished gold.</p>

<p>Both from the history and appearance of this
edifice the antiquary will enter it with sensations
of awe and veneration, but he will find with
regret that the ancient Roodloft has been lately
removed, from an idea that it deadened the voice
of the preacher, and that the parishioners have
also converted the original forms into modern
pews, a change which has cruelly violated the
venerable uniformity of the interior. There is a
singular monument in the church, in the shape of
a coffin, having an inscription around the border
in very rude characters, and now partly obliterated;
it is in Norman French, and has been thus
translated.</p>

<div class="poem">
CLARICE<br />
<br />
The wife of Geffrei de Bollait lies here<br />
God of her soul have mercy<br />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>On the middle of the stone is represented a
Cross fleury, standing on four steps; the monument
is said to have been found many years ago
by the sexton, while sinking a grave.</p>

<p>Opposite the great door in the church-yard
stands a very ancient Cross, on one side of which
are five balls, and, on the other, a rude figure
intended to represent the crucified Saviour. We
here present our readers with a sketch of this
singular monument.</p>

<p>Another Cross stands in the road, and faces the
entrance into the church-yard, of which also we
have introduced a delineation.</p>

<p>The Deanery is in the gift of the Crown, as a
royal peculiar, and is tenable with any other
preferment. The Dean exercises an independent
jurisdiction in all ecclesiastical matters within
the parish of St. Burian, and its dependent parishes
of St. Levan, and Sennan. He is the
Rector, and is entitled to all tithes. A Visitation
court is held in his name, and the appeal from it
is only to the King in council. Athelstan is said
to have granted to this church the privilege of a
Sanctuary, and a ruin overgrown with ivy; standing
on an estate called <i>Bosliven</i>, about a mile
east from the church, is thought to be its remains,
but Mr. Lysons justly observes that the <i>Sanctuary</i>
usually comprised the church itself, and perhaps
a certain privileged space beyond it, and that the
ruins to which the tradition attaches, are probably
those only of an ancient chapel.</p>

<p>From St. Buryan the traveller may at once
return to Penzance, which is about six miles distant,
but as no object of particular interest will
occur in the direct road, it is unnecessary for us
to attend him thither. Should he, however, be
inclined to extend his excursion, he will receive
much gratification in returning by a somewhat
circuitous route along the southern coast, through
the parish of Saint Paul. In this case, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
first proceed to <i>Boskenna</i>, the seat of John
Paynter Esq. a highly romantic spot, abounding
with woodcocks, and which under the direction
of a skilful landscape gardener might be made to
emulate in beauty any of the charming villas that
adorn the under-cliff of the Isle of Wight. On
this estate there is a superficial quarry of decomposing
granite, which the mineralogist ought to
visit, for the purpose of obtaining some remarkably
fine specimens of felspar in separate crystals,
which may be easily removed from the mass
in which they lie imbedded.</p>

<p>At <i>Bolleit</i>, in a croft near Boskenna, and adjoining
the high road, is to be seen a circle of
stones very similar to that we have already described
(p. <a href="#Page_81">81</a>,) except that it has not a central
pillar; the appellation given to these stones is
that of the "<i>Merry Maidens</i>," on account of a
whimsical tradition, that they were once young
women transformed like Niobe into stones, as
a punishment for the crime of dancing on the
Sabbath day. In a field on the opposite side of
the road there are two upright stones standing
about a furlong asunder, the one being nearly
twelve, the other sixteen feet in height. They
are probably sepulchral monuments; the same
ridiculous tradition, however, attaches to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
as to the circle, and has accordingly bestowed
upon them the appellation of the "<i>Pipers</i>."</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Carn Boscawen</span>, on this coast, is to be
seen a very extraordinary group of rocks, consisting
of a large flat stone, the ends of which
are so poised upon the neighbouring rocks, as to
leave an opening underneath; <i>Dr. Borlase</i>, with
his accustomed zeal, insists upon its Druidical
origin, and ever ready to supply the deficiency
of both history and tradition by the sallies of an
active imagination, very confidently informs us,
that "this said opening beneath the pensile stone
was designed for the seat of some considerable
person, from which he might give out his edicts,
and decisions, his predictions, and admissions to
Noviciates"!&mdash;<i>Risum teneatis geologici?</i></p>

<p>In our road to Saint Paul, we pass <i>Trouve</i>, or
<i>Trewoof</i>, an estate situated on the side of a
woody hill, overlooking a romantic valley, which
is terminated by <i>Lemorna Cove</i>, a spot which
should be visited by every stranger who delights
in the "lone majesty of untamed Nature."
Within the estate of Trouve are the remains of a
triple entrenchment, in which runs a subterranean
passage; and, it is said, that during the civil
wars a party of Royalists were here concealed
from the observation of the forces of Sir Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Fairfax. There is a fine chalybeate spring on
this estate.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Kerris</span>, in the parish of Paul, about five
miles from Penzance, is an oval enclosure called
"<i>Roundago</i>," which is stated to have been connected
with Druidical rites; time and the Goths,
however, have nearly destroyed its last remains,
so that the antiquary will require the eyes of a
Borlase to recognise its existence by any description
hitherto given of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul Church</span> is a very conspicuous object
from its high elevation,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and interests the historian
from the tradition, already stated, of its
having been burnt by the Spaniards, upon which
occasion the south porch alone is said, in consequence
of the direction of the wind, to have
escaped the conflagration. A pleasing confirmation
of this tradition was lately afforded during
some repairs, when one of the wooden supporters
was found charred at the end nearest the body of
the church. It also deserves notice that the thick
stone division at the back of the <i>Trewarveneth</i>
pew, which has so frequently occasioned enquiry,
is a part of the old church, which escaped the
fire. In the church is the following curious notice
of its having been burnt, "<i>The Spanger
burnt this church in the year 1595</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>Most tourists inform us that in this church-yard
is to be seen the monumental stone, with
the epitaph of <i>Old Dolly Pentreath</i>, so celebrated
among antiquaries, as having been the last person
who spoke the Cornish language. Such a
monument, however, if it ever existed, is no
longer to be found, nor can any information be
obtained with regard to its probable locality.
Her Epitaph is said to have been both in the
Cornish and English language, viz.</p>

<div class="poem">
"Coth Dol Pentreath canz ha deaw<br />
Marir en Bedans en Powl pleu<br />
Na en an Eglar ganna Poble braz<br />
Bet en Eglar Hay Coth Dolly es!"<br />
<br />
"Old Dol Pentreath, one hundred age and two<br />
Both born, and in Paul Parish buried too;<br />
Not in the Church 'mongst people great and high<br />
But in the Church-yard doth old Dolly lie!"<br />
</div>

<p>In the parishes of Paul and Buryan are several
Tin streams; in some of which the <i>Wood Tin</i>, or
wood-like oxide of Tin, is occasionally found in
large, and well defined pieces. It has been also,
although rarely, found in its matrix.</p>

<p>From Paul Church we may proceed to Penzance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
either by the high road over Paul Hill,
which becomes extremely interesting from the
picturesque beauty and superior cultivation of
the country; or we may descend towards the sea
shore, and return through the villages of <i>Mousehole</i>
and <i>Newlyn</i>, which may be called colonies
of Fishermen, for here the Pilchard<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and Mackarel
fisheries are carried on to a very great extent;
and every kind of fish which frequent this
coast are caught and sent to Penzance, and other
Cornish towns; and, in the early part of the
season, they supply the London market with
Mackarel, which are conveyed thither by way of
Portsmouth. The Lobster fishery also proves
an ample source of revenue to the Mount's Bay
fishermen, from which alone they divide not less
than Two Thousand Pounds, annually.</p>

<p>The ride or walk along the coast from <span class="smcap">Mousehole</span>
to <span class="smcap">Newlyn</span> is highly interesting. The
former town which is situated about two miles
south-west of Penzance; and half a mile from
Paul Church-town, contains about six hundred
inhabitants. There is a small Pier capable of
admitting vessels of one hundred tons burthen;
but it is chiefly used as a harbour for the numerous
fishing boats.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Newlyn</span>, with respect to population, exceeds
by one-third that of Mousehole. It has a commodious
pier, which is also usually occupied by
the fishing boats of the place, which exceed four
hundred in number. In the cliff-road between
these villages, we pass a platform, which during
the late war was a <i>battery</i>, forming a security to
the bay from any privateers that might visit it.
Adjoining this battery stands a furnace for the
purpose of heating the shot. It was under the
direction of a small party of the Royal Artillery.</p>

<p>The Geologist in performing this part of the
excursion will have much to observe. About
one hundred yards west of Mousehole, the clay-slate
ceases, and the granite commences. At
this junction numerous granite veins, varying in
width from about a foot to less than an inch, pass
through the slate.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> A little farther west, a cavern
may be observed in the cliff, which has evidently
been produced by the decomposition of the walls
of an old <i>Adit</i>. In this cavern the Mineralogist
has found good specimens of <i>Eisenkeisel</i>, or Iron
flint:&mdash;but we will conclude, for our tourist
must be wearied by the length of the excursion;
tomorrow we shall be again prepared to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
him in a different direction, and to point
out a succession of fresh objects, when antiquities,
minerals, and picturesque views will, in
their turn, again present themselves for his examination.</p>

afforded by the furze in the process of Baking, has given
origin to the general use of pies. Every article of food is dressed
in a pie, whence it has become a proverb, that "<i>the Devil will
not come into Cornwall, for fear of being put into a pie</i>." In a
season of scarcity the Attorneys of the county having at the
Quarter Sessions very properly resolved to abstain from every

introduced into an Epigram, extemporaneously delivered on the

considerably greater, for many of the blocks, in consequence of
being damaged, have been condemned and sold at a low price to
the inhabitants for building, and other purposes. The number of
men generally employed in quarrying it is about four hundred;
their wages from twelve to eighteen shillings per week, varying
with the quantity raised. The lord of the soil receives one halfpenny
a foot for all that is quarried; the freight during war was
as high as 25 shillings per ton, at present it is only 16s. Fourteen

<h2>EXCURSION III.</h2>

<div class="center">
TO BOTALLACK MINE; CAPE CORNWALL; AND THE
MINING DISTRICT OF SAINT JUST.
</div>


<p>To exhibit the greatest variety of interesting
objects, in the least possible space and time, may
be said to constitute the essential excellence of a
"<i>Guide</i>." For the accomplishment of such a
purpose we now proceed to conduct the stranger
to <i>Botallack Mine</i> and <i>Cape Cornwall</i>, through
the Parishes of Madron, Morvah, and Saint Just.</p>

<p>In our road to the village of Madron, or
Madron <i>Church-town</i>, as it is commonly called,
we pass <i>Nancealverne</i>, the estate of John Scobell
Esq., <i>Poltair</i>, the residence of Edward Scobell
Esq., and <i>Trengwainton</i> the seat of Sir Rose
Price, Bart. At this latter place considerable
exertions have been made to raise plantations,
and to clothe the granitic hills behind it with
wood; and from the progress already made, we
feel sanguine in the ultimate success of the enterprize.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Amongst the pictures in the possession of
the worthy Baronet are several of the earlier
productions of Opie. The head of an aged beggar,
by that artist, has frequently excited our
admiration, and presents a characteristic specimen
of the native simplicity and expression of his
style, and the magic force of his chiaro-scuro.
This head was painted also under circumstances,
a knowledge of which cannot fail to heighten its
interest. The father of Sir Rose having been
struck by the venerable aspect of an aged mendicant
as he was begging in the streets of Penzance,
immediately sent for Opie, then residing in the
town, and expressed a desire that the young
artist should paint his portrait. The beggar was
accordingly regaled with a bounteous meal upon
the occasion, and Opie appears to have caught
his expression at the happy moment, when like
the "Last Minstrel" of our northern bard,</p>

<div class="poem">
&mdash; "Kindness had his wants supplied<br />
And the old man was gratified."<br />
</div>

<p>The Village of Madron is about two miles to
the north-west of Penzance. The church is
placed on an elevated situation, and commands
a very striking view of Saint Michael's Mount,
and its bay. Penzance is a Chapelry of this
parish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madron Well</span> is situated in a moor about a
mile and a half from the <i>Church-town</i>. It is
enclosed within walls, which were partially destroyed
in the time of Cromwell, by Major Ceeley
of St. Ives, but the remains of them are still sufficiently
entire to exhibit the form of an ancient
Baptistry.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The inner wall with its window
and door-way, and the altar with a square hole
or socket in the centre, which received the foot of
the cross or image of the patron saint, are still
perfect. The foundation of the outer wall, or
anti-room, may be traced with great ease.</p>

<p>Superstition has, of course, attributed many
virtues to waters which had been thus hallowed,
and this Well, like that of Chapel Euny, has been
long celebrated for its medicinal efficacy in restoring
motion and activity to cripples,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Baptism
was administered only at the stated times of Easter
and Whitsuntide; but, at all seasons, the virtues
of the waters attracted the lame and the impotent;
and the altar was at hand to assist the
devotion of their prayers, as well as to receive
the offerings of their gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Chemical analysis has been unable to detect in
this water the presence of <i>any</i> active ingredient
that might explain the beneficial operation attributed
to it.</p>

<p>In the road to Morvah we meet with the celebrated
<i>Cromlech</i><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> at Lanyon. It is placed on a
prominent hill, and from its lonely situation, and
the wildness of the country by which it is surrounded,
it cannot fail to inspire sensations of
reverential awe in every one who approaches
it.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> This rude monument has been long known
amongst the country people by the appellation
of the "<i>Giant's Quoit</i>." When the last edition
of this "<i>Guide</i>" went to the press it was still
standing in its original position, and was thus
described. It consists of three unshapen pillars
inclining from the perpendicular, which support
a large table stone (resembling a <i>Discus</i> or <i>Quoit</i>)
in a horizontal position, the direction of which
is nearly north and south. The flat stone is 47
feet in girth, and 12 in length, and its height
from the ground is sufficient to enable a man on
horseback to pass under it.&mdash;The aged monument,
however, has at length bent beneath the
hand of time, and fallen on its side. Its downfall,
which happened during a violent tempest,
occasioned a universal feeling of regret in the
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same tenement, about a quarter of a
mile west of Lanyon house, is another monument
of this kind, nearly as large as the former; and
it is singular that this should have been the only
Cromlech in Corwall which escaped the notice
of Dr. Borlase. It has fallen on its edge, but
is still entire.</p>

<p>All our notions respecting the origin and use
of these monuments are purely conjectural; it
seems, however, very probable that they are the
most ancient in the world, erected possibly by
one of the first colonists which came into the
island. As Cromlechs are known to abound in
every country where the <i>Celts</i> established themselves,
many antiquaries have concluded that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
they are of Celtic origin. The same doubt and
uncertainty involve every consideration with respect
to their use; it has been a general idea
that they were intended for altars, but the upper
stone is evidently too gibbous ever to have admitted
the officiating priest, or to have allowed
him to stand to overlook the fire, and the consumption
of the victim; besides, what occasion
is there to suppose a Cromlech any thing more
than a sepulchral monument? Is it not the most
natural and probable conclusion? Indeed Mr.
Wright actually found a skeleton deposited under
one of them in Ireland, and it must strike
the most superficial observer that our modern
tombs are not very dissimilar to the former in
their construction, and probably derived their
form from a very ancient model.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Men-an-Tol.</span> The next object of curiosity
consists of three stones on a triangular plane,
the middle one of which is perforated with a large
hole, and is called <i>Men-an-Tol</i>, i. e. the <i>holed
stone</i>. Dr. Borlase who, as we have often observed,
has recourse to the chisel of Druidism to
account for every cavity or crevice, conjectures
that it was appropriated to the rites of that
priesthood, and asserts, on the authority of a
farmer, that even in his time, it was deemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
possess the power of healing those who would
crawl through it.</p>

<p>In a croft, about half a mile to the north-west
of Lanyon, lies a very ancient sepulchral stone,
called by the Cornish "<i>Men Skryfa</i>," i. e. the
<i>Inscribed Stone</i>. It is nine feet ten inches long,
and one foot eight inches broad; the inscription
upon it is "<i>Riolobran Cunoval Fil</i>," which signifies
<i>Riolobran the Son of Cunoval lies buried
here</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> With respect to the date of this monument,
all antiquaries agree in thinking that it must have
been engraven before the corruptions crept into
the Roman alphabet, such for instance as the
junction of the letters by unnatural links, or
when the down strokes of one were made to serve
for two, &amp;c. This practice arose soon after the
Romans went off, and increased until the Saxon
letters were introduced at Athelstan's conquest.
The most striking deviation from the Roman
orthography to be observed in this monument is
in the cross stroke of the Roman N not being
diagonal as it ought to be, nor yet quite horizontal
as we find it in the sixth century; and hence
it is fair to assign to it a date antecedent to that
period.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chun Castle</span>, a prominent object in this
neighbourhood, is similar to <i>Caerbran Round</i>,
which has been described, except that the ruins
are more extensive, and less confused. The remains
occupy the whole area of a hill commanding
a wide tract of country to the east, some low
grounds to the north and south, and the wide
expanded ocean to the west. Another Cromlech
may also be seen from this spot, and stands upon
the very line which divides the parishes of Morvah
and Saint Just; but it is far inferior to that
at Lanyon. We will now for awhile abandon
the contemplation of these faded monuments of
past ages, and proceed to the examination of a
rich and interesting field of mineralogical and
geological research. In introducing the stranger,
however, to the district of Saint Just, we must
repeat to him the caution with which Mr. Carne<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
has very prudently accompanied his history of its
mineral productions. "If the stranger on his
arrival shall expect to find any of the minerals so
prominently situated as to salute his eyes at
once; or if he shall suppose that those objects
which are especially worthy of notice in a geological
point of view, are to be discovered and
examined in the space of a few hours, he will be
greatly mistaken and disappointed; for very few,
either of the minerals or the veins are to be found
<i>in situ</i>, except by a diligent, patient, and persevering
search."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>Without further delay we shall now attend the
traveller to <i>Pendeen Cove</i>; in our road to which,
the only objects worthy attention are the Stamping
Mills, and Burning Houses or Roasting Furnaces,
belonging to <i>Botallack Mine</i>. They are
situated on the bank of the river which runs into
the sea at <i>Pendeen Cove</i>. The Tin ore of <i>Botallack</i>
is generally mixed with a portion of <i>Sulphuret
of Copper</i>, which not being separable from it
by the mechanical process of dressing, is submitted
to the action of a roasting furnace, by
which the Copper being converted into an oxide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and the Sulphur into Sulphuric acid, <i>a Sulphate
of Copper</i> is thus produced, which is easily separated
by washing. The solution obtained is then
poured into casks, containing pieces of iron, by
the agency of which the <i>Copper</i> is <i>precipitated</i>.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>There is to be seen at <i>Pendeen</i>, a cave, known
by the name of <i>Pendeen Vau</i>, and concerning
which there are many ridiculous stories. It appears
to have been one of those hiding places in
which the Britons secreted themselves, and their
property, from the attacks of the Saxons and
Danes. The cave is still almost entire, a circumstance
which is principally owing to the superstitious
fears of the inhabitants, many of whom,
at this very day, entertain a dread of entering it.</p>

<p>At <i>Pendeen Cove</i>, the Geologist will meet with
several phenomena well worthy his attention.
At the junction of the Slate and Granite, veins
of the latter will be observed traversing the former
rock, and what is particularly worthy of
notice, they may be seen emanating from a great
mass of granite and passing into the schistose rock
by which it is covered. One part of the cliff of
this cove consists of large fragments of granite
imbedded in clay and earth; the interstices of
which are filled with white sand, which has been
probably blown there from the beach; through
this sand, water impregnated with iron is slowly
percolating, the effect of which is the induration
of the sand, and the formation of a <i>breccia</i>, which
in some parts has acquired very considerable
hardness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>Before proceeding to the metalliferous district
of Saint Just, we may observe that, if the traveller's
object be to reach Saint Ives by the road
along the cliffs, through the parish of <i>Zennor</i>, he
will meet with a most cheerless country, but by
no means destitute of geological interest. He
ought particularly to examine a bold rocky promontory,
called the "<i>Gurnard's Head</i>," where
he will find a succession of beds of slaty felspar,
hornblende rock, and greenstone. The geology
of this headland has been accurately described
by <i>Dr. Forbes</i> in the second volume of the <i>Transactions
of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall</i>.
<i>Polmear Cove</i> ought also to be visited on
account of the Granite veins, which are perhaps
as singular and interesting as any of those already
described.&mdash;But let us proceed to complete our
examination of the coast of <i>Saint Just</i>. Many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the mines are situated on the very edge of the
cliff, and are wrought to a considerable distance
under the sea; but all communication to them
is from land.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> For a description of the numerous
minerals found in this district,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> we must
refer the reader to the highly valuable paper by
<i>Joseph Carne, Esq</i>. which is published in the
second volume of the <i>Transactions of the Royal
Geological Society of Cornwall</i>. We cannot, however,
allow the mineralogist to pass <i>Trewellard</i>,
without reminding him that, at this spot, <i>Axinite</i>
was first discovered in Cornwall, and that the
most beautifully crystallized specimens of that
mineral, scarcely inferior to those brought from
Dauphiné, may still be procured here. In the
cliff at <i>Huel Cock Carn</i>, a vein of this mineral,
of a violet colour, three feet in width, may be
traced for upwards of twenty yards; and in its
vicinity there is to be found also a vein of <i>garnet
rock</i>. <i>Apatite</i>, of a greyish-white colour, associated
with <i>Hornblende</i>, may be seen in the same
spot. In the slate rocks between <i>Huel Cock</i> and
Botallack, <i>Prehnite</i> has lately been found, for
the first time; it appears to form a small vein,
which in one part is divided into two branches.
Upon the discovery of the above mineral, says
Mr. Joseph Carne, an expectation was naturally
formed, that <i>Zeolite</i>, its frequent associate, and
an equal stranger to Cornwall, might shortly
make its appearance. This opinion has been
lately verified by the discovery of, at least, two
varieties of that mineral, imbedded in the <i>Prehnite</i>
vein, viz. <i>Stilbite</i>, or <i>foliated Zeolite</i>, crystallized
in flat four-sided prisms, with quadrangular summits;
and the <i>radiated Mesotype</i>, which sometimes
contains nodules of <i>Prehnite</i>. Other specimens
have been found in rather an earthy state,
and may possibly be the <i>mealy Zeolite</i> of Jameson.
In the same slate rocks <i>Apatite</i> occurs of a yellowish-green
colour, and crystallized in hexaedral
prisms. In the granite rocks on the high hills
south-east of Trewellard, <i>Pinite</i> is to be observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>We arrive at the "<i>Crown Engine</i>" of Botallack&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"How fearful</span><br />
And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low,<br />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>This is undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary
and surprising places in the mining districts
of Cornwall, whether considered for the rare and
rich assemblage of its minerals, or for the wild
and stupendous character of its rock scenery.
Surely, if ever a spot seemed to bid defiance to
the successful efforts of the miner, it was the site
of the <i>Crown Engine</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> at Botallack, where at the
very commencement of his subterranean labours,
he was required to lower a steam engine down a
precipice of more than two hundred feet, with
the view of extending his operations under the
bed of the Atlantic ocean!!! There is something
in the very idea which alarms the imagination;
and the situation and appearance of the gigantic
machine, together with the harsh jarring of its
bolts, re-echoed from the surrounding rocks, are
well calculated to excite our astonishment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>But if you are thus struck and surprised at the
scene when viewed from the cliff above, how
much greater will be your wonder if you descend
to the surface of the mine. You will then behold
a combination of the powers of art with the wild
sublimity of Nature which is quite unparalleled;
the effects of the whole being not a little heightened
by the hollow roar of the raging billows
which are perpetually lashing the cliff beneath.
In looking up you will observe troops of mules
laden with sacks of coals, for the supply of the
engine, with their undaunted riders, fearlessly
trotting down the winding path which you trembled
at descending even on foot. As you approach
the engine, the cliff becomes almost perpendicular,
and the ore raised from the mine is
therefore drawn up over an inclined plane,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> by
means of a horse engine placed on the extreme
verge of the overhanging rocks above, and which
seems to the spectator below as if suspended in
"<i>mid air</i>."</p>

<p>The workings of this mine extend at least
seventy fathoms in length under the bed of the
sea; and in these caverns of darkness are many
human beings, for a small pittance, and even that
of a precarious amount, constantly digging for
ore, regardless of the horrors which surround
them, and of the roar of the Atlantic ocean, whose
boisterous waves are incessantly rolling over their
heads. We should feel pity for the wretch who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
as an atonement for his crimes, should be compelled
to undergo the task which the Cornish
miner voluntarily undertakes, and as cheerfully
performs; yet such is the force of habit, that very
rarely does any other employment tempt him to
forsake his own; the perils of his occupation are
scarcely noticed, or if noticed, are soon forgotten.</p>

<p>The <i>Lode</i><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> of the mine may be seen <i>cropping
out</i>, in the group of rocks beneath the engine.
The ore is the grey and yellow sulphuret of copper,
mixed with the oxide of tin,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of which <i>she</i><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
has already "<i>turned up</i>" a sufficient quantity to
afford a very handsome premium to the adventurers.
In the grey sulphuret of this mine, <i>purple
copper ore</i>, of the kind called by the Germans
"<i>Buntkupfererz</i>," is frequently met with. Besides
which, a great number of interesting minerals
may be collected, as several varieties of
<i>Jasper</i>; <i>arborescent native Copper</i>; <i>Jaspery iron
ore</i>; <i>Arseniate of Iron</i>, which until it was discovered
in the <i>Crown lode</i> of Botallack, was unknown
in St. Just. It is of a brown colour, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
crystallized in cubes. <i>Sulphuret of Bismuth</i>, imbedded
in <i>Jasper</i>; beautiful <i>specular iron ore</i>;
<i>hæmatitic Iron</i>; and the <i>hydrous oxide of iron</i>, in
prisms terminated by pyramids, and which was
supposed by the Count de Bournon to contain
<i>Titanium</i>. The picturesque rocks of this district
may be considered as composed of <i>Hornblende
rock</i>, which will be found to alternate with slate.
The contorted appearance of the former in the
vicinity of Botallack is very singular, and will
admit of much speculation. The <i>Crown rocks</i>,
to which the mineralogist must not neglect to
descend, consist of extremely compact <i>Hornblende
rock</i>, in which occur numerous veins and beds of
different minerals; viz. <i>veins of Garnet rock</i>, with
numerous imbedded crystals, being at one part
almost a foot in width; <i>Magnetic Iron Pyrites</i>,
massive, in beds, near the engine; its colour is
bluish-grey, and it is called by the workmen
<i>Spelter</i>, who mistake it probably for <i>Blende</i>,
which latter mineral also occurs here in considerable
quantities. In a part of the rock, which is
almost inaccessible, there is a vein of <i>Epidote</i>,
distinctly crystallized, and about six inches wide.
The miners, however descend the fearful precipice
without any difficulty, in order to collect specimens
for the inquisitive visitant. <i>Axinite</i> also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
occurs in veins, or perhaps in beds; <i>Thallite</i>, <i>Chlorite</i>,
<i>Tremolite</i>, and a black crystallized <i>Schorl</i>, in
which the late Rev. William Gregor detected six
per cent. of <i>Titanium</i>, are to be found also in this
interesting spot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cape Cornwall</span> is the next object of interest
after Botallack. This point of land stretches out
to the west, at an elevation of two hundred and
thirty feet, and forms the northern boundary of
<i>Whitsand Bay</i> (p. <a href="#Page_88">88</a>). It is entirely composed
of a slaty rock, traversed by numerous veins of
<i>Actinolite</i>. To the geologist this spot will be
interesting, since on the shore beneath, a junction
may be observed between the <i>Granite</i> of the
Land's End, and the slate of this promontory.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
These formations are separated by a large vein
of <i>metalliferous quartz</i>, which forms the <i>lode</i> of
the mine in the neighbourhood, called "<i>Little
Bounds</i>," and whose engine suspended in the
cliff above, constitutes a very striking feature in
the scenery. This vein, besides <i>Oxide of Tin</i>,
for which it is worked, contains <i>Native Copper</i>,
different <i>Oxides of Iron</i>, <i>Red Jasper</i>, <i>Quartz</i> of a
bright brownish red colour, and <i>Scaly red Iron</i>
<i>ore</i>, sometimes investing Quartz, and occasionally
in small masses consisting of red cohering scales,
which are unctuous to the touch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Carne states, that in this mine three distinct
lodes, distant from each other, have been
worked under the sea; two of them being in
granite, the third in slate. Here also, at two
parts of the <i>lode</i>, known by the name of "<i>Save-all's
lode</i>," probably, as the name would seem to
imply, in consequence of the avarice of the miner,
a communication has been made between the sea
and the mine; one of them is at about high water
mark at spring tides; the other is covered by the
sea at every tide, except at very low neaps; great
and constant attention is therefore necessary for
the security of this latter breach. At first the
opening was stopped by a piece of wood covered
with turf; but as this defence was not found to
be sufficiently secure, a thick platform caulked
like the deck of a ship, was ultimately placed
upon it, and which renders it nearly water proof.
The breaking of the waves is heard in all the
levels of the mine, and in the part directly beneath
the pebbly beach, the rolling of the stones
in boisterous weather produces a most terrific
effect. In the drift at the forty fathom level,
which is carried a considerable way under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
sea, Mr. Chenhalls, the intelligent agent of the
mine, had formerly observed a successive formation
of <i>Stalactites</i>; in consequence of which statement,
Dr. John Davy and Mr. Majendie were
induced to visit the spot. It had been closed for
two years previously, but before it was shut up
Mr. Chenhalls had carefully removed all the
<i>Stalactites</i> which then existed. Upon examination
it was observed that a fresh crop had been produced
during the interval just stated; some of
which were eighteen inches in length, and above
an inch in diameter. The <i>Stalagmites</i> directly
underneath them were of still larger dimensions;
both however had the same yellowish-brown colour,
and were found to consist of <i>Peroxide of
iron</i>. Specimens may be seen in the cabinet at
Penzance. Dr. Paris has suggested that they
resulted from the decomposition of <i>Pyrites</i>, forming,
in the first instance, a soluble <i>Sulphate of
iron</i>, but which, by attracting farther oxygen,
deposited its base in the form here discovered.</p>

<p>At a little distance southward of Cape Cornwall,
is a high rocky promontory called <span class="smcap">Caraglose
Head</span>, from which the traveller may
command one of the most interesting views in
this part of Cornwall. On the north are Cape
Cornwall, and the romantic machinery of <i>Little</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<i>Bounds Mine</i>. Southward and directly under the
head, the interesting creek called <span class="smcap">Pornanvon
Cove</span>, with the engine of <i>Huel St. Just Tin
Mine</i> near the sea shore. Westward, on a clear
day, the Scilly Islands may be distinctly seen.
This is a spot seldom visited by strangers, but
with the exception of Botallack, it is certainly
one of the most striking in the district of Saint
Just. At <i>Pornanvon Cove</i>, a stratum of sea sand
and pebbles may be seen in the cliff, at an elevation
of fifteen feet above high water mark!</p>

<p>Advancing from the coast into the interior of
the country towards Saint Just's <i>Church-town</i>,
Dr. Berger observed many blocks of <i>Schorl rock</i><a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
scattered on this part of the granitic plain, particularly
amongst the rubbish of some old tin
mines, which are here very numerous, but are
now quite deserted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Just Church Town.</span> Nothing of any
interest is to be seen at this place, except a very
ancient cross, a sketch of which we shall introduce
at the conclusion of the present chapter;
and the remains of an ancient Amphitheatre.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>In this, and similar "<i>Rounds</i>," as they are
provincially called, the ancient British assembled,
in order to witness those athletic sports, for which
the Cornish are still remarkable; indeed, at this
very day, wrestling matches are held in the amphitheatre
at Saint Just, during the holidays of
Easter and Whitsuntide.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The Antiquary ought not to quit this parish
without visiting the "<i>Botallack Circles</i>;" when
examined separately they do not differ essentially
from that at <i>Bolleit</i>, or at <i>Boscawen Un</i> before
described (p. <a href="#Page_81">81</a>); but they intersect each other
and form a confused cluster; "but in this seeming
confusion," exclaims Dr. Borlase, "I cannot
but think that there was some mystical meaning,
or, at least, distinct allotment to particular uses;
some of these might be employed for the sacrifice,
others allotted to prayer, others to the feasting
of the priests, others for the station of those who
devoted the victims; and lastly, that these circles
intersected each other in so remarkable a
manner, as we find them in this monument, might
be to intimate that each of these holy rites, though
exercised in different circles, were but so many
links of one and the same chain, and that there
was a constant dependance and connection between
sacrifice, prayer, holy feasting, and all the
several parts of Druidical worship."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<p>In taking leave of the metalliferous district of
Saint Just we have to observe, that it has been
considered by Mr. Carne, and not without probability,
as having constituted the principal portion
of what was formerly known under the name
of the <i>Cassiterides</i>, and that if it would redound
to the honour, or contribute to the prosperity of
Saint Just, it might be said, "that her Tin was
probably a constituent part of the Shield and
Helmet of Achilles,&mdash;of the Tabernacle of the
Israelites,&mdash;of the Purple of Tyre,&mdash;and of the
Temple of Solomon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>From Saint Just's <i>Church-town</i>, the road conducts
us over a wild part of the peninsula, although
highly salubrious, and invigorating from
the fine sea breezes which blow from every side;
after a ride over such bleak and barren hills, the
eye experiences a singular repose on our approach
to the cultivated shores of the Mount's
Bay.</p>

<h2>EXCURSION IV.</h2>

<div class="center">TO SAINT IVES, HAYLE, HUEL ALFRED, &amp;c.</div>


<p>Passing through the little village of Chyandour,
we ascend by a shady road through that of
Gulval, to <i>Kenegie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> the seat of the family of
John Arundel Harris Arundel, Esq. This spot
commands a very interesting view of the Mount's
Bay, the beauty of which is greatly heightened
by the diversified and picturesque foreground.
On a neighbouring hill is <i>Rosmorran</i>, the retired
cottage ornée of George John, Esq. of Penzance;
we scarcely know a situation where the
skill of the landscape gardener could be exerted
with greater advantage or effect.</p>

<p>Pursuing the road, and passing the gate of
Kenegie, we ascend the great granite range
which extends from Dartmoor to the Land's
End, and which appears, in this part of the
country, to be broken into a number of detached
groups. Upon the summit of one of these hills
stands a castellated building which, although of
modern construction, occupies the site of an ancient
hill castle, called "<i>Castle an Dinas</i>;" it
was erected by John Rogers, Esq., as a picturesque
object from his occasional residence at
<i>Treassowe</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<p>On descending the northern side of the granite
ridge, a curious atmospheric phenomenon is frequently
observable,&mdash;the clear and cloudless sky
becoming suddenly dense and hazy; the change
is evidently occasioned by the condensation of
the vapours contained in the warm and rarefied
air of the Mount's Bay, by the colder one which
blows from the Bristol channel. Amidst wild
and rugged hills the road winds to Saint Ives, in
the course of which, the geologist will have
many opportunities of furnishing his portfolio
with sketches, in illustration of the changes
which time and weather produce on Granite;
huge blocks of this stone lie scattered on all
sides, while stupendous masses are seen on the
hills above in different stages of decomposition,
and which from their threatening attitude, would
appear as if in preparation to join their former
companions in the plains below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Ives.</span> This populous sea port and
borough stands on the shores of the Bristol Channel,
in a very fine bay bounded by bold rocks of
<i>Greenstone</i> and <i>Slate</i>. The latter of these rocks
is in many places undergoing rapid decomposition,
in consequence of which large masses of
the Hornblende rock have fallen in various directions,
and given a singular character of picturesque
rudeness to the scene: this is remarkably
striking in the group of rocks which constitute
Godrevy Island.</p>

<p>Saint Ives is a populous sea port, of very considerable
antiquity, deriving its name from that
of <i>Iia</i>, a religious woman, who came hither from
Ireland in about the year 460. The Corporation,
which obtained its powers from a charter granted
by Charles the First, consists of a mayor, recorder,
town-clerk, twelve capital burgesses, and
twenty-four inferior burgesses. The Borough
returns two members to Parliament, a privilege
which was conferred in the fifth year of Queen
Mary; and the right of election was vested in
all the householders in the parish paying scot
and lot. In the year 1816, the magistrates, and
trustees of the Pier and Port of Saint Ives resolved
to extend the former, and to construct a
breakwater, in order to shelter it. The undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
has been commenced, but it is at present
far from being completed.</p>

<p>Saint Ives is the birth place of the <i>Reverend
Jonathan Toup</i>, Rector of Saint Martin's near
Looe, the learned annotator of <i>Suidas</i>, and editor
of <i>Longinus</i>. His father was formerly the lecturer
of this town.</p>

<p>On no part of the Cornish coast is the Pilchard
fishery carried on with greater activity or success;
and at the time of large draughts, it is
usual for all the inhabitants to contribute their
assistance; shops and dwelling-houses are frequently
deserted on such occasions, and even the
church has been abandoned, when large shoals
have made their appearance on the Sabbath!
By a certain signal given by a person stationed
on the heights, the approach of a shoal is generally
announced to the town; the effect is most
singular. Trumpets are immediately heard in
different parts, and the inhabitants rushing from
their houses, and quitting their ordinary occupations,
are to be seen running in all directions,
and vociferating the word "<i>Hever&mdash;Hever&mdash;Hever</i>."&mdash;What
the term signifies, or whence it
was derived, no one can conjecture, but its sound
is no less animating to the ears of a Saint Ives-man,
than is the cry of "<i>To Arms</i>," to the Son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of Mars; and the tumult which it excites is more
like that of a besieged city, than the peaceable
and joyful bustle of an industrious fishing town.</p>

<p>As we have not hitherto described the manner
in which the Pilchard Fishery is conducted, perhaps
the present will be an appropriate opportunity.</p>

<p>The Pilchard, in size and form, very much
resembles the common Herring,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and is actually
confounded with it by Linnæus, under the name
of "<i>Clup&oelig;a Harengus</i>;" upon close inspection,
however, an essential difference may be readily
discovered. The Pilchard is less compressed, as
well as smaller; there is besides a very simple,
and common test of distinction, depending upon
the dorsal fin of the Pilchard being placed exactly
in the centre of gravity, if therefore it be
taken up by this fin, it will preserve an equilibrium;
while the body of the Herring, when so
tried, will dip towards the head. Mr. Pennant
likewise observes that the scales of the latter
easily drop off, whereas those of the Pilchard
adhere very closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been commonly stated that these fish
migrate from the North sea in immense shoals,
during the summer months, and reach the Cornish
coast about the middle of July, where they
remain until the latter end of September, when
they again depart to the arctic regions. This
statement, however, cannot be correct, as the
fish are never seen off the coasts of Scotland, the
northern shores of Ireland, the Isle of Man, nor,
in fact, off any coast north of Cornwall. It
would therefore seem more probable, that they
come from some part of the Western ocean, and
return thither at the end of the season. Within
the last ten years a considerable alteration in
their usual course has taken place, much to the
disappointment of the Cornish Fishermen; they
have kept at a greater distance from the shores;
whether this circumstance has arisen from their
food being farther than usual out at sea, or from
any alteration in the currents, it is impossible to
ascertain. In the present year, however, they
seem to have returned to Saint Ives; an immense
quantity, calculated at three thousand hogsheads,
having been taken at one "<i>catch</i>," by two <i>Seines</i>
in this bay. The other parts of the coast have
been visited only by very small shoals.</p>

<p>The preparations for this fishery are generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
commenced about the end of July,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> as the period
at which the Pilchards are expected to pay their
annual visit. As they usually make their appearance
here in the evening, the boats engaged
in the adventure seldom go to sea before three or
four o'clock in the afternoon, and as rarely remain
longer than ten. On some occasions, however,
they go out again very early in the morning,
and have sometimes succeeded in taking fish
at sun rise. The fishermen, arranged in boats
which are scattered at a little distance from each
other, are directed to the shoals by persons who
are stationed on the cliffs, or who sometimes
follow in boats. These persons who are called
"<i>Huers</i>," probably from the <i>hue and cry</i> which
they raise, discover them by the peculiar red
tint<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> which the water assumes, and from other
indications with which they are well acquainted.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The spot where the nets should be cast, or "<i>shot</i>"
having been determined from the signals of the
"<i>Huer</i>," the boat containing the great net or "<i>Stop
Seine</i>" as it is called, and which is frequently as
much as 300 fathoms in length, and 10 in depth,
is gradually cast from the boat into the sea by
two men, as the vessel is gently rowed round the
shoal by others of the crew; a service which is
performed with such dexterity that in less than
four minutes the whole of this enormous net is
<i>shot</i>, and the fish enclosed. Upon this occasion
it is always the first care of the <i>Seiner</i> to secure
that part to which the fish were swimming; and
then so to carry the net around them, that they
shall be hemmed in on every side. The net immediately
spreads itself, the corks on one edge
rendering it buoyant, and the leaden weights on
the other causing it to sink to the bottom; for if
the depth of the water should exceed that of the
<i>Seine</i>, it is evident that there would be little
probability of securing any fish, however large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the shoal might be. As the circle in which the
Seine is shot, is generally larger than the net can
compass, its two extremities are at a distance
from each other when the whole is in the water.
Ropes are therefore carried out from each of
these ends, by which they are <i>warped</i> together
by the men on board the two large boats, so as to
bring them into contact. When this is effected,
the two extremities, if the shoal be large, are
lifted from the bottom, and expeditiously tacked
together. During this last operation every method
is adopted to agitate the water, and drive
back the body of fish from this only aperture
through which they can escape. This having
been accomplished, the fish remain within the
enclosure formed by the encircling net, which
extends from the surface to the bottom of the
sea. It only now remains to secure the Seine in
its position, for which purpose <i>grapnels</i>, or small
anchors, are carried out at some distance on
every side, the ropes from which are fastened to
the rope at the upper end of the net; these <i>grapnels</i>
will of course retain the Seine in its circular
position, and preserve it against the influence of
the tides, and the changes of the weather. Where,
however, the shore is sandy and shelving, as in
Saint Ives' Bay, the <i>Seine</i> is at once drawn into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
shallow water by a number of men, who are
called "<i>Blowsers</i>."</p>

<p>The quantity of fish which is thus secured will
depend of course on many contingent circumstances,
such for instance, as the strength of the
tides, the nature of the coast, and the dexterity
of the fishermen, &amp;c. A Seine has sometimes
enclosed as many as fifteen hundred, or two
thousand hogsheads. The next operation is to
remove the fish from the Seine, and to convey
them in boats to the shore. This is performed
by another smaller net, termed a "<i>Tuck net</i>,"
and the process is called "<i>Tucking</i>," and is a
sight which the stranger should not, on any account,
neglect to witness. This busy scene always
takes place at low water, and when it happens
on one of those calm evenings which so
frequently occur in the summer season, it is impossible
to imagine a more exquisite scene. The
moon shedding her lustre on the sea displays its
surface covered with vessels, sailing or rowing
in all directions to the Seine, whilst her beams
by striking upon the dripping fish as they are
poured, by baskets, from the <i>tuck net</i> into boats,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
produce an appearance which resembles a stream
of liquid silver.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p>There is another mode of catching Pilchards
of "<i>Driving Nets</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which are drawn after
their respective boats, fastened only at one end;
in the meshes of which the fish are arrested as
they attempt to pass. This species of fishery is
always carried on at a considerable distance from
the shore, lest, by approaching too near the land
they should disperse the shoals which the <i>Seiner</i>
is waiting to enclose. The quantity thus taken
is very small; but the fish are remarkably fine,
and the expense of the adventure is comparatively
trifling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p>The fish, having been brought to the fish cellars,
undergo the process of being "<i>cured</i>;"
which is performed by laying them up in broad
piles, "<i>in bulk</i>," as it is called, and salting them
as they are piled up, with bay salt. In this situation
they generally remain for forty days, although
the time allowed for their lying <i>in bulk</i> is often
regulated by the interests of the merchant, who,
it may be supposed, is ever ready to avail himself
of any favourable turn in the foreign markets.
The period directed by Government is that of
thirty-three days. During this process a great
quantity of oil, blood, and dirty pickle, drains
from the fish; and which, from the inclination of
the floor, immediately find their way into a receptacle
placed for their reception.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The Pilchards,
when taken from the bulk, are carried to
large troughs, in which they are washed, and
completely cleansed from the salt, filth, and coagulated
oil which they had acquired.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> They are
then packed into hogsheads, and pressed by a
strong lever, for the purpose of squeezing out the
oil, which issues through a hole at the bottom of
the cask; the pressing continues for a week, and
formerly ten gallons of oil were procured from
every hogshead, but at this time, not more than
four can be obtained; such a change in the fatness
of the fish is not easily to be explained. The
hogsheads are now <i>headed up</i>, and exported to
the different ports of the Mediterranean, principally
to the Italian ports; and upon every hogshead
so exported, Government allows a bounty
of 8s 6d. Upwards of 30,000 hogsheads are annually
consumed in England; and above 100,000
have been exported in one year. The quantity
of salt necessary to cure a hogshead of fish is estimated
at about 300 lbs. and the expense of the
whole for that quantity, including the cask, salt,
labour, &amp;c. is from £1:3s to £1:6s; and it has
been calculated that the bounty, together with
the value of the oil (from £20 to £28 per ton),
will in general reimburse the whole expense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>This fishery is in every respect of the highest
importance to the county of Cornwall, affording
employment to at least twelve thousand persons,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
whilst the capital engaged cannot be fairly estimated
at less than three hundred and fifty, or
four hundred thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The broken and refuse fish are sold at about
10d per bushel, for manure, and are used throughout
the county with excellent effects, especially
for raising all green crops; they are usually mixed
with sand, or soil, and sometimes with sea
weed, to prevent them from raising too luxuriant
a crop, arising from a too rapid decomposition;
thus employed their effects are very permanent,
and there is a popular belief that a single pilchard
will fertilize a foot square of land for
several years; and certain it is, that after the
apparent exhaustion of this manure, its powers
may be again excited by ploughing in a small
proportion of <i>quick lime</i>, which will produce a
still further decomposition of the animal matter,
and develope a fresh succession of those elements
which are essential to the growth of vegetable
substances.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>
<p>The Herring fishery is also carried on to a
great extent at Saint Ives; this fish appears after
the pilchard has quitted the shores, and is much
smaller than that which is caught on the northern
coasts of Britain; which corroborates the general
opinion, that the farther it migrates to the south,
the more it decreases in size. It is also worthy
of remark that, notwithstanding the great abundance
of this fish in the Bristol Channel, it very
seldom passes the Land's End, and is consequently
rarely caught in the Mount's Bay, or on
the southern shores of Cornwall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>But let us return from this digression, and proceed
with our excursion.&mdash;</p>

<p>Quitting Saint Ives by the eastern road, we
are conducted along an elevated cliff, which
affords a complete command of every object in
the bay; in our route we pass <i>Tregenna Castle</i>,
the seat of Samuel Stephens, Esq. and on the
summit of a lofty hill, about a mile from this
mansion, stands a pyramid, which immediately
attracts the notice of the traveller, as well on
account of the singular wildness of its situation,
as the complete absence of every shrub, or rural
ornament, with which such objects are usually
associated. It was erected by the late eccentric
John Knill, Esq., a bencher of Gray's Inn, and
some time collector of the Port of Saint Ives, it
having been intended as a Mausoleum for the reception
of his remains, although he afterwards
revoked this intention, and ordered his body to
be given to an anatomist in London, for dissection.
On one side of this pyramid is inscribed,
"<i>Johannes Knill</i>," on another, "<i>Resurgam</i>,"
and on a third, "<i>I know that my Redeemer
liveth</i>." He directed in his will, that at the end
of every five years, a Matron and ten girls,
dressed in white, should walk in procession, with
music, from the market house at Saint Ives, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
this pyramid, around which they should dance,
singing the hundredth Psalm!</p>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">&mdash;&mdash;"Pueri circum innuptæque puellæ</span><br />
Sacra canunt."<br />
</div>

<p>For the purpose of keeping up this custom, he
bequeathed some freehold lands, which are vested
in the officiating minister, the mayor, and the
collector of the port of Saint Ives, who are allowed
Ten Pounds for a dinner. The first celebration
of these <i>Quinquennial rites</i> excited, as
may easily be supposed, very considerable interest
throughout the western parts of the county.</p>

<div class="poem">
"No tongue was mute, nor foot was still,<br />
But <i>One and All</i><a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> were on the hill,<br />
In chorus round the tomb of Knill."<br />
</div>

<p>The report which was drawn up at the time by
an eye witness of these festivities, exhibits such
an admirable specimen of the <i>mock Heroic</i>, that
we feel assured that the tourist will thank us for
having given insertion to it in the Appendix.</p>

<p>Pursuing the road along the cliff we pass <i>Lelant</i>
church, and arrive at the river <i>Hayle</i>, which
takes its rise near Crowan, and falls into Saint
Ives Bay; although it arrives at the level of the
sea three miles before it reaches the northern
coast, and winds its way through an area of sand,
nearly half a mile wide, and more than two miles
long; this sand, at high water, is generally submerged,
so that the traveller who wishes to cross
is obliged to take a circuitous route over the
bridge at <i>Saint Erth</i>; but upon the ebbing of
the tide, it soon becomes fordable, and may be
passed over even by foot passengers. It is a
curious circumstance that at twelve o'clock at
noon, and at midnight, it is <i>always</i> fordable;
this apparent paradox is solved by knowing, that
at <i>Spring tides</i> it is always low water at these
hours, and that the <i>Neap tides</i> never rise sufficiently
high to impede the passage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<p>The Port of Hayle is situated on the eastern
side of the river, where a great trade is carried
on with Wales for timber, coals,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> iron, and limestone;
and with Bristol, for earthen-ware, groceries,
&amp;c. It is also one of the principal places
of export for the copper ore of the western mines.
In the former edition of this work we described
the processes by which the <i>smelting</i> and <i>refining</i>
of Copper were conducted at this place, but as it
was acknowledged to be much cheaper to carry
the ore to the coal, than to bring the coal to the
ore, the proprieters found themselves compelled
to abandon the speculation. The buildings in
the neighbourhood, however, still continue as
memorials of the former existence of such works,
having been constructed with square masses of
the <i>scoria</i>,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> which had been cast into moulds for
such purposes, as it issued from the furnace. In
the museum of the Geological Society at Penzance
the stranger may see an interesting model
of this <i>Copper House</i>, and of the furnaces employed
in the reduction of the ore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>There are now at Hayle two very extensive
Iron Founderies, in which are cast the largest
engines which have been hitherto erected on
mines. They are wrought partly by water, and
partly by Steam Engines. Near the Copper
House the traveller will not fail to notice the
fine back-water dam, which was constructed
about thirty years since, for the scouring out of
the harbour. The effect has been a considerable
reduction of the sand which forms its bottom, so
that ships of much greater burden may now enter
it. The plan and execution of this work, which
was undertaken at the expense of the then existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Hayle Copper Company, reflect great credit
on the late <i>John Edwards, Esq.</i>, who first conceived
its practicability and advantage, and under
whose direction it was completed. A phenomenon
occurred at these works some years ago
which afforded a curious illustration of the secret
and destroying agency of Galvanic electricity. The
flood gates were found to undergo a very rapid
decay, which was perfectly inexplicable, until
the engineer ascertained that it depended entirely
upon the contact of iron and copper bolts
and braces, which had been introduced into the
different parts of the frame work.</p>

<p>The country around Hayle is entirely desolated
with sand, consisting of minutely comminuted marine
shells, and which, with some few interruptions
extends all along the coast, from Saint Ives
to near Padstow, and in many places is drifted
into hills of sixty feet in elevation. There can
be but little doubt that this sand was originally
brought from the sea side by hurricanes, but not
even a popular tradition remains of the time or
manner of this extensive devastation, which has
reached, with some distinct intervals, nearly forty
miles in length. Some allusion to this event has
been supposed to have been discovered amongst
the ancient records of the Arundel family, fixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the period about the twelfth century; but <i>Mr.
Boase</i> observes, that the fact of the churches still
remaining more or less ingulphed, the age of
which does not much exceed three centuries,
decisively refutes such a conjecture. On the
other hand, it would appear that in the <i>liber
valorum</i> of Henry the Eighth, the living of <i>Gwythian</i>
was estimated far above its proportion to
adjoining parishes. By the shifting of the sand
by high winds, the tops of houses, and the ruins
of ancient buildings, may be occasionally seen at
this very day; and in some places a great number
of human bones have been discovered, derived
from the cemetries which have been formerly
inundated.</p>

<p>The farther progress of the sand flood is at
length arrested by extensive plantations of the
<i>Arundo Arenaria</i>, or common sea rush.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>The most important geological circumstance
connected with the history of this sand is, that
on several parts of the coast, it is passing into
the state of a solid compact rock! The fact was
first investigated by Dr. Paris, who has published
a memoir upon the subject in the first volume of
the Transactions of the Geological Society of
Cornwall; and as every scientific traveller must
be desirous of exploring so interesting a phenomenon
we have extracted, from the paper above
mentioned, such notices as may be useful in
assisting his researches.</p>

<p>"The <i>Sandstone</i> which occurs on the northern
coast of Cornwall undoubtedly affords one of the
most splendid and instructive instances of a
<i>Recent Formation</i> upon record. We actually
detect Nature at work in changing calcareous
sand into stone; and she does not refuse admittance
into her manufactory, nor does she conceal
with her accustomed reserve the details of the
operations in which she is engaged. It does not
however appear that any geologist has fully
availed himself of so rare an indulgence;&mdash;to
drop the allegory, no complete or satisfactory
explanation has been hitherto afforded of this
most interesting formation, nor of the phenomena
which attend it. At the period that Dr. Borlase
wrote his History of Cornwall, the science of
Chemistry had scarcely dawned; we cannot therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
feel surprised at his having attributed '<i>the
concretion of shelly sand to the agglutinating quality
of sea water</i>'."</p>

<p>"The sand first appears in a slight, but encreasing
state of aggregation on several parts of
the shore in the Bay of Saint Ives; but on approaching
the Gwythian river it becomes more
extensively indurated. On the shore opposite
to Godrevy Island, an immense mass occurs of
more than a hundred feet in depth, containing
entire shells and fragments of clay-slate; and it
is singular that the whole mass should assume a
very striking appearance of stratification. In
some places, it appears that attempts have been
made to separate it, probably for the purpose of
building, for several old houses in Gwythian are
entirely built with it. The rocks in the vicinity
of this recent formation in the Bay of Saint Ives
are <i>Greenstone</i> and <i>Clay-slate</i>, which appear to
alternate. But it is around the promontory of
<i>New Kaye</i>, in Fistrel Bay, in the parish of Saint
Columb Minor, that the geologist will be most
struck with this formation, for here there is
scarcely any other rock in sight. The cliffs,
which are high and extend for several miles, are
wholly composed of it, and are occasionally intersected
by veins and dykes of <i>Breccia</i>. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
cavities hang calcareous stalactites of rude appearance.
The beach is covered with disjointed
fragments, which have been detached from the cliff
above, many of which weigh at least from two to
three tons. The sandstone is also to be here seen
in different stages of induration; from a state in
which it is too friable to be detached from the
rock upon which it reposes without crumbling,
to a hardness so considerable as to require a very
violent blow from a hammer to break it;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> indeed
holes are actually bored in some parts for the
purpose of admitting cables with which vessels
are moored. Buildings are here commonly constructed
of it, and the church of Crantock is
entirely built with it. By the inhabitants the
stone is employed for various articles of domestic
and rural &oelig;conomy."</p>

<p>"The Geologist, who has previously examined
the celebrated specimen from Guadaloupe, enclosing
a human skeleton, and which is now in
the British Museum, will be forcibly struck with
the great similitude which this stone bears to it;
and suspecting that masses might be found containing
human bones imbedded, if a diligent
search were made in the vicinity of those cemetries
which have been overwhelmed, I made an
excursion with my friend Sir Christopher Hawkins,
for that purpose; but time and patience failed us,
and the discovery is reserved for some more persevering
and fortunate member of the society."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>"Such then is the nature and situation of this
most interesting formation. In the next place,
we have to enquire into the causes which have
operated in thus consolidating the sand, and into
the peculiar circumstances under which the operation
has been conducted."</p>

<p>"It will appear that there are at least three
distinct modes by which the <i>lapidification</i> of calcareous
sand may be effected, and that the present
formation is capable of affording characteristic
examples of each."</p>

<p>"The three species of cementing matter to
which I allude, are all deposited from water in
which they either exist chemically dissolved, or
mechanically suspended. The water deriving
them from the substances through which it percolates;
thus is the first species of cement obtained&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. <i>By the percolation of water, through a stratum
of calcareous sand, by which it becomes
impregnated with carbonate of lime.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>By the percolation of water through strata
containing decomposing Sulphurets; by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>which it becomes impregnated with Sulphuric
salts.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>By the percolation of water through decomposing
Clay-slate, or any other ferruginous
strata; by which it becomes impregnated
with Iron, Alumina, and other mineral
matter.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In the first case, the very small proportion of
carbonate of lime which is held in solution will
necessarily render it a powerful cement, since the
density and compactness of a precipitate will generally
vary, inversely as the rapidity with which it
is deposited. This fact is familiarly illustrated by
the obstinate adhesion of calcareous incrustations
to the interior surfaces of water decanters. In
the second case, wherein a sulphuric salt would
appear to act the part of a cement, it may be observed,
that the <i>sulphatization of pyrites in the
presence of calcareous matter is a very general
source of gypsum</i>. The granular gypsum from
the Falls of Niagara, which is described by Dr.
Kidd as being "as white as snow," owes its
origin to a natural process of this decomposition;
for I am informed by Dr. Maclure of Philadelphia,
who has visited the spot, that it is formed
in consequence of the action of water upon decomposing
slate, which contains numerous veins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of <i>carbonate of lime</i> and <i>sulphate of iron</i>. I have
also in my possession a series of incrustations
which were taken out of steam boilers in Cornwall,
one of which presents an admirable instance
of the formation of <i>sulphate of lime</i>, its surface
being beautifully studded with its crystals; the
water which supplied the boiler, and by the evaporation
of which this substance was deposited,
was derived from a mine in clay-slate intersected
with veins of <i>Pyrites</i> and <i>carbonate of lime</i>."</p>

<p>"With regard to the third species of cementing
matter, viz. <i>Oxide of Iron</i>, it is scarcely necessary
to state, that in the induration of mineral
bodies Iron has been long known to act a very
important part; the most superficial observer
must have noticed the concretions which so frequently
appear on the beach around a rusty nail,
or any fragment of iron, while the mineralogist
must be acquainted with the proofs which Mr.
Kirwan has collected in support of the fact. Nor
is the part which it performs in the disintegration
of mineral bodies less obvious; by its agency we
have seen a loose sand become a hard rock, but if
we extend our inquiry we shall find that <i>Iron</i> by
attracting a farther proportion of <i>oxygen</i> from
air or moisture, soon crumbles into dust, and
thus proves the immediate cause of the decomposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of that very rock, of which it formerly
constituted the indurating ingredient. In this, as
in every other operation, Nature preserves her
uniformity, producing the most diversified and
opposite effects by the modified application of
the same principles."</p>

<p>For this long digression we feel conscious that
some apology is necessary; the extreme interest
as well as novelty of the phenomenon will at
once suggest a sufficient excuse to the geologist;
and to other observers it may at least be pleaded
in extenuation, that they have lost nothing by
the delay, for it has been in a district which offers
but few objects of amusement or instruction.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half south-east of Hayle is
<i>Huel Alfred</i>, which was some years ago one of
the richest and most profitable Copper mines in
the county. The adventurers gained a clear
profit of nearly £130,000 during the period in
which it was wrought. In the year 1816, from
various causes, this mine was stopped, but about
six months ago a company of London gentlemen
embarked in the concern, and commenced their
operations in a very spirited manner. Before
Midsummer 1824, they expect to set at work two
steam-engines with cylinders of the immense size
of 90 inches in diameter, and one of less dimensions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
This mine will undoubtedly prove attractive
and interesting to the mineralogist, as, during
the last period of working, several curious
and rare minerals were discovered, as <i>Stalactitic</i>,
<i>swimming</i>, and <i>cubic quartz</i>; <i>carbonate</i>, and <i>phosphate
of Lead</i>; <i>stalactitic</i>, <i>botryoidal</i>, and <i>investing
Calcedony</i>, &amp;c. The lodes of this mine are
so large that should the stranger intend to visit
the interior of the earth, he cannot select a better
opportunity.</p>

<p>About a mile east of <i>Huel Alfred</i> are situated
the <i>Herland Mines</i>, which, after an interval of
twenty years, have been lately set at work again.
The adventurers in these mines are also principally
London capitalists, who have erected two
steam-engines of which the cylinders are 80 inches
in diameter. The mineralogist will not fail to
visit mines which were celebrated for the beautiful
specimens of <i>Native Silver</i>, <i>Vitreous Silver
ore</i>, and <i>black oxide of Silver</i>, found there during
the last period of its working, an account of
which, by the Rev. M. Hitchins, was published
in the Philosophical Transactions for the year
1801.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable contrast between the
lodes of <i>Huel Alfred</i> and those of <i>Herland</i>. The
former being few, but very large; the latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
small but very numerous, and the ore peculiarly
rich.</p>

<p>The stranger may now proceed to Redruth,
between which place and Hayle, there is a regular
line of rich Copper mines, but as we propose
to examine this metalliferous district in a future
excursion, we shall return by <i>Saint Erth</i> to Penzance.</p>

<p>The desolate and barren appearance of the
country in the neighbourhood of Hayle Sands, is
much relieved by the woodland scenery of <i>Trevethoe</i>,
the seat of the family of <i>Praed</i>; the father
of the present possessor first introduced the <i>Pineaster
Fir</i>, as a nurse for the growth of forest
trees, and the estate of Trevethoe, as well as
many others in the county, affords a striking
evidence of the expediency of the plan. To the
same gentleman we are indebted for the introduction
of the <i>Arundo arenaria</i>, above mentioned.</p>

<p>Arriving at the bridge of <i>Saint Erth</i>, the traveller
will perceive that a considerable portion
of the breadth of the peninsula is here penetrated
by an arm of the sea, and that the land which
succeeds it in a direction towards the south is so
low, that a canal might easily be cut along the
hills which terminate at Marazion, and a communication
be thus opened between the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and Irish Channels; or that an iron rail-way for
the conveyance of coals, sand, &amp;c. might be constructed
at a comparatively small expense.</p>

<p>At <i>Saint Erth</i>, were formerly situated the
"<i>Rolling Mills</i>" for reducing blocks, or bars of
Copper, into flat sheets, as described in the first
edition of this "Guide;" since, however, the
Copper-works at Hayle have been abandoned,
these mills have been used for rolling and hammering
iron.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of <i>Saint Erth</i> is <i>Tredrea</i>,
the Cornish residence of Davies Gilbert, Esq.
M. P.</p>

<p>On our return to Penzance an opportunity
occurs of witnessing the operation of <i>smelting</i>
Tin ore.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> It consists in first heating the ore,
with about an eighth part of <i>Culm</i>,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> in a reverbatory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
furnace for six hours, during which period
the sulphur and arsenic are volatilized, and the
ore is reduced to its metallic state; the furnace
is then <i>tapped</i>, and the liquid metal <i>run out</i>; a
second melting, however, is necessary before it is
sufficiently pure to be cast into <i>blocks</i>,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and assayed
at the Coinage. After this last melting,
and before the Tin is poured into the moulds, a
piece of green apple-tree wood is thrown into
the liquid metal, and kept under its surface; the
effect of which is to throw up the <i>scoria</i> with rapidity;
it would seem to act merely in producing
a violent ebullition by the sudden disengagement
of steam. One hundred parts of the oxide of Tin
("<i>Black Tin</i>") at an average will yield about
65 parts of metal, or <i>White Tin</i>, as it is technically
termed.</p>

<p><i>Ludgvan Church</i>, which appears upon an elevation
on the right of the road leading to Penzance,
and which forms so prominent a feature on the
shores of the bay, will be visited by the Antiquary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
with sensations of respect, when he learns that it
contains the mortal remains of Dr. Borlase the
venerable and learned author of the Natural History
and Antiquities of Cornwall. From the Latin
Inscription on his tomb it appears that he was
fifty-two years rector of this parish, and that he
died August 31st 1772, in the 77th year of his
age. Although Dr. Borlase spent the greater
part of a long life in this retired district, his fame
as a scholar had spread through all the literary
circles of the age. If we require any other testimony
of his talents than that which his own
works will afford, we may receive it from no less
an oracle than <span class="smcap">Pope</span>, with whom he regularly
corresponded. In a letter written by the Poet,
to express his thanks for the present of a Cornish
diamond, presented by Dr. Borlase for the decoration
of his grotto, Pope thus expresses himself,
"I have received your gift, and have so placed
it in my grotto, that it will resemble the donor&mdash;<i>in
the shade, but shining</i>."</p>

<p>If in the course of the present work we have
ventured any remarks upon the opinions of Dr.
Borlase which may be considered in the slightest
degree disrespectful to his talents, we willingly
offer this expiation at his shrine. His errors,
whatever they may have been, were the inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
consequence of the infant state of those
sciences indirectly connected with his pursuits,
not the result of literary incapacity, or of depraved
judgment.</p>

<h2>EXCURSION V.</h2>

<div class="center">TO REDRUTH, AND THE MINING DISTRICTS IN ITS
VICINITY.</div>


<p>In the present excursion, the traveller in search
of the Picturesque will meet with but meagre
fare; for many a mile has the face of nature been
robbed of all ornament, and the interior of the
earth has been scattered over its surface in the
anxious pursuit of mineral treasures. The unsightly
mounds of rubbish thus produced have
been accumulating for centuries, and are so highly
impregnated with mineral matter that not a
blade of grass will vegetate upon them.</p>

<p>The intelligent traveller, however, must not
anticipate an excursion as destitute of interest
and variety as the surface of the country which
he is about to traverse, for like the shabby mien
of the miser, its aspect but ill accords with its
hoards; and the total absence of cultivation and
rural ornament, is soon forgotten amidst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
richest field of mineralogical enquiry which any
country ever afforded.</p>

<p>As our present object is to afford the stranger
such directions as may enable him to inspect this
mining district with advantage, and to visit whatever
is interesting and instructive in connection
with it, it may in the first instance be expedient
to offer a general outline of the modes in which
the Cornish mines are worked, before we enter
into the details of topographical description.</p>

<p>For many centuries<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> the Tin Mines in Cornwall
have given to the country a very important
place in the &oelig;conomical history of nations, and
furnished a perpetual source of employment to a
very large population, which exclusive of the
artisans, tradesmen, and merchants, cannot be
estimated at less than sixty thousand persons.</p>

<p>All the transactions connected with the Tin
Mines are under the controul of the Stannary
Laws. Courts are held every month, and they
decide by juries of six persons, with a progressive
appeal to the Lord Warden, and Lords of
the Duke of Cornwall's council; no custom,
however, or ancient law, prevails as to the working
of Copper or Lead in the Stannaries, and
therefore all agreements are made upon such
terms as are decided on by the contracting
parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>At present the greatest metallic product of the
county is Copper,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> although this metal is, comparatively
of modern discovery, and has not
been worked longer than a century. The reason
assigned for its having so long remained concealed
is the assumed fact, that Copper generally
occurs at a much greater depth than Tin, and
that, consequently, the ancients for want of
proper machinery to drain off the water were
compelled to relinquish the metallic vein before
they reached the Copper; it is stated by Pryce,
in his <i>Mineralogia Cornubiensis</i>, as a general
rule, that Tin seldom continued rich and worth
working lower than 50 fathoms; but of late years
the richest Tin mines in Cornwall have been
much deeper. <i>Trevenen Mine</i> was 150,&mdash;Hewas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<i>Downs</i> 140,&mdash;<i>Poldice</i> 120, and <i>Huel Vor</i> is now
upwards of 130 fathoms in depth.</p>

<p>Upon the first discovery of Copper ore, the
miner to whom its nature was entirely unknown,
gave it the name of <i>Poder</i>; and it will hardly
be credited in these times, when it is stated, that
he regarded it not only as useless, but upon its
appearance was actually induced to abandon the
mine, the common expression upon such an
occasion was, that "<i>the ore came in and spoilt
the Tin</i>."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> About the year 1735, Mr. Coster, a
mineralogist of Bristol, observed this said <i>Poder</i>
among the heaps of rubbish, and seeing that the
miners were wholly unacquainted with its value,
he formed the design of converting it to his own
advantage; he accordingly entered into a contract
to purchase as much of it as could be supplied.
The scheme succeeded, and Coster long
continued to profit by Cornish ignorance.</p>

<p>The mines in the county of Cornwall consist
chiefly of Tin and Copper, besides which there
are some which yield Lead<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, Cobalt,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Silver.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The ores are in veins which are provincially
termed <i>Lodes</i>, the most important of
which run in an east and west direction; during
their course they vary considerably in width,
from that of a barley-corn to 36 feet;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> the average
may be stated at from one to four feet. It
is, however, by no means regular, the same lode
will vary in size from six inches to two feet, in
the space of a few fathoms. No instance has yet
occurred of lodes having been cut out in depth;
the deepest mine now at work is <i>Dolcoath</i>, which
is about 235 fathoms from the surface to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
lowest part.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> <i>Crenver</i> and <i>Oatfield</i> have lately
been stopped; they were 240 fathoms deep. The
rocks through which the lodes descend are of
different kinds, thus are Copper and Tin found
in <i>granite</i>, as well as in <i>slate</i>.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The Tin in these
veins<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> generally occurs in the state of an <i>oxide</i>;
the only Copper ore of any consequence is <i>Copper
Pyrites</i>, or Sulphuret of Copper; the <i>arseniates</i>,
<i>carbonates</i>, &amp;c. being too small in quantity
to be of any importance in a mining point of
view. <i>Iron</i> and <i>Arsenical Pyrites</i> are also very
common attendants, and are both confounded
under the name of <i>Mundic</i>. Besides the metalliferous
veins which run easterly and westerly,
we have already stated that there are others, not
generally containing ore, which maintain a direction
from North to South, and on that account
are called <i>cross courses</i>, and often prove to the
miner a great source of trouble and vexation;
for they not only cut through the other veins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
but frequently alter their position, or <i>heave</i> them,
as it is termed; and it is a very curious fact that
most of the <i>Tin</i> and <i>Copper</i> lodes, thus <i>heaved</i>,
are shifted in such a manner, as to be generally
found by turning to the <i>right</i> hand; <i>left</i> handed
heaves being comparatively rare. In <i>Huel Peever</i>
this vexatious phenomenon occurred, and it was
not until after a search of forty years that the
<i>lode</i> was recovered.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The discovery of metalliferous
veins is effected by various methods, the
most usual one is by sinking pits to the solid
rock, and then driving a trench north and south,
so as to meet with every vein in the tract through
which it passes; the process is a very ancient
one, and is termed <i>Costeening</i>.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The operation,
however, of opening a new mine from the surface,
or from <i>Grass</i>,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> as it is called, is not one
of frequent occurrence.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
The reworking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
mines which have been formerly abandoned, on
account of the produce being insufficient to pay
the costs, from the fall of the standard price of
ore, is quite sufficient to absorb all the speculative
spirit of the country.</p>

<p>But by whatever accident or method a lode
may be discovered, the leave of the proprietor of
the soil must be obtained before any operations
can be commenced, except in such cases of Tin
Mines as are anciently <i>embounded</i> according to
the provisions of the Stannary Laws. The owner
of the land is technically called the <i>Lord</i>, whose
share (which is termed his <i>Dish</i>) is generally
one-sixth, or one-eighth of the profits; the
parties who engage to work the mine are called
<i>Adventurers</i>, their shares depending upon their
original contributions and agreements.</p>

<p>When it has been determined to work a mine,
three material points are to be considered; viz.
the discharge of the water,&mdash;the removal of the
barren rock and rubbish (<i>deads</i>),&mdash;and the raising
of the ore. One of the first objects, therefore, is
to cut an <i>Adit</i>,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> as it is called, which in an inclined
underground passage, about six feet high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and 2&frac12; wide, and is generally commenced at the
bottom of a neighbouring valley, and is driven
up to the vein, for the purpose of draining it of
water above their point of contact; these <i>Adits</i>
are sometimes continued to a very considerable
distance, and although the expense of forming
them is necessarily very considerable, yet they
are found to afford the most &oelig;conomical method
of getting rid of the water, in as much as it saves
the labour of the steam-engine in raising it to
(<i>Grass</i>) the surface. As soon as the vertical
aperture, or <i>Shaft</i>, is sunk to some depth, a
machine called a <i>Whim</i> is erected, to bring up
the <i>deads</i>, and ore. It consists of a perpendicular
axis on which a large hollow cylinder of timber,
termed the <i>Cage</i>, revolves; and around this a
rope, directed down the <i>Shaft</i> by a pulley, winds
horizontally. In the axis a transverse beam is
fixed, at the ends of which two horses are fastened,
and going their rounds haul up a basket
(or <i>Kibbul</i>) full of ore, or <i>deads</i>, whilst an empty
one is descending.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> As the lode never runs down
perpendicularly it is necessary to cut galleries,
called <i>Levels</i>, horizontally on the vein, one above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
another. These levels are, in the first instance,
about two feet wide, and six feet high, but varying
according to circumstances, and being frequently
extended much beyond their original dimensions.
They are driven one above the other
at intervals of from 10 to 20, or 30 fathoms.
When extended to a certain distance from the
original vertical <i>Shaft</i>, it is necessary, for the
sake of ventilation, as well as for other reasons,
to form a second which is made to traverse all
the levels in the same manner as the first. A
communication is frequently only made between
two galleries by a partial shaft (called a <i>Wins</i>) in
the interval between the two great shafts. When
there are more than one lode worked in the same
mine, as frequently happens, <i>Levels</i> often run
parallel to each other at the same depth. In this
case they communicate by intermediate <i>Levels</i>
driven through the rock (or <i>Country</i> as it is
called) which are denominated <i>Cross-cuts</i>. A
mine thus consists of a series of horizontal galleries,
generally one above the other, but sometimes
running parallel, traversed at irregular intervals
by vertical shafts, and all, either directly
or indirectly, communicating with each other.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The subterranean excavations are effected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
breaking down the looser parts by the pickaxe,
and by <i>blasting</i> the more solid rock by gunpowder.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
In accomplishing this latter operation
the most melancholy accidents have occurred, in
consequence of the iron rammer coming in contact
with some siliceous substance, and thus striking
fire. The recurrence of this evil it is hoped
has been prevented by the laudable efforts of the
Geological Society as above related (see page <a href="#Page_30">30</a>),
and that the "<i>Iron Age</i>" has taken its final departure.</p>

<p>If the traveller is inclined to descend into a
mine he is to be first accoutred in a flannel
jacket and trowsers, a close cap, an old broad-brimmed
hat, and a thick pair of shoes; a lighted
candle is put into one hand, and a spare one suspended
to a button of his jacket. The flannel
dress is worn close to the skin, in order to absorb
the perspiration, and every part of the ordinary
dress is laid aside; thus equipped, if he possess
sufficient strength of nerve, he may descend the
vertical ladders with the most perfect ease and
security;&mdash;but will a view of the mine repay all
this trouble and fatigue?&mdash;let us hear what Dr.
Forbes has said upon this occasion.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>"A person
unacquainted with the details of mining, on being
informed of many hundreds of men being employed
in a single mine, might naturally imagine
that a visit to their deep recesses would afford a
picturesque and imposing spectacle of gregarious
labour and bustle, tremendous noise, and much
artificial brilliancy to cheer the gloom. Nothing,
however, is further from the truth, as far as regards
the mines of Cornwall; for, like their fellow
labourers the moles, the miners are solitary
in their operations. Seldom do we find more
than three or four men in one <i>level</i>, or gallery, at
a time, where they are seen pursuing the common
operations of digging or boring the rock, by the
feeble glimmering of a small candle, stuck close
by them, with very little noise or much latitude
for bodily movement; besides whom there are
generally one or two boys employed in wheeling
the broken ore, &amp;c. to the shaft. Each of these
boys has also a candle affixed to his wheelbarrow,
by the universal subterranean candlestick, a piece
of clay. A certain band of men, who, however
numerous, are always called "<i>a Pair</i>," generally
undertake the working of a particular <i>Level</i>.
These subdivide themselves into smaller bodies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
which, by relieving each other at the end of every
six or eight hours, keep up the work uninterruptedly,
except on Sunday. By means of this
subdivision of <i>the Pairs</i>, there is in general not
more than one-third of the underground labourers
below at any one time. Very seldom are the
miners within the sound of each other's operations,
except occasionally when they hear the dull
report of the explosions. In the vicinity of the
main shaft, indeed, the incessant action of the
huge chain of pumps, produces a constant, but
not very loud noise, while the occasional rattling
of the metallic buckets against the walls of the
shaft, as they ascend and descend, relieves the
monotony both of the silence and the sound. Still
every thing is dreary, dull, and cheerless; and
you can be with difficulty persuaded, even when
in the richest and most populous mines, that you
are in the centre of such extensive and important
operations." For keeping the workings from
being inundated, each mine is furnished with a
chain of pumps, extending from the bottom to
the <i>adit-level</i>, worked by a single pump-rod; each
pump receiving the water brought up by the one
immediately below it. All the water of the deepest
level finds its way into the bottom of the
mine, technically called the <i>Sump</i>, whence it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
finally elevated to the adit, through which it
flows by a gentle descent to the surface.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>We have yet to notice a fact connected with
the natural history of these subterranean recesses,
which has lately excited a very considerable share
of interest in the members of the Cornish Geological
Society,&mdash;that <i>the natural temperature of the
earth in these mines is considerably above that of
the mean of the climate, and increases with the
depth, at the rate of about one degree for every 50
or 60 feet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Does there exist then a permanent
source of heat in the interior of the earth?</p>

<p>The business of a mine is managed by a foreman,
called the <i>Captain</i>, who keeps the accounts,
and pays and regulates the miners; there are
also <i>Under-ground Captains</i>, who have the immediate
inspection of the works below. There exists
a popular belief that the Cornish miner frequently
lives under ground for many days, or weeks,
without ever visiting the surface. This is never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the case at any time, or under any circumstances.
He does not even eat, much less sleep, in the
mine, but returns <i>to grass</i>, and to his home, often
many miles distant, at whatever depth he may
have been working, when relieved from his labours.</p>

<p>With respect to the value of the mines, considered
as property, it may be observed, that
the whole concern is a Lottery, in which there
exist many blanks to a prize, and were the whole
of the speculation to be invested in any one individual,
there is no doubt but that, after paying
the required dues to the lords of the soil, and
defraying the necessary expenses for working the
mines, he would at the conclusion of the year
be a loser by many thousand pounds. It is very
true that there are many cases of extraordinary
gain,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> but these are balanced by more numerous
concerns in which loss is incurred. How then
does it happen that any capitalists can be induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to engage in the speculation? The answer is obvious,
for the very same reason that they are
induced to purchase tickets in the State Lottery.
There are moreover additional motives which
induce individuals of a certain description to
embark in the speculation, although, as simple
adventurers, they may scarcely anticipate success,
such are landholders, who are naturally
desirous of promoting an undertaking from which
they must necessarily receive considerable dues;
or merchants, who by becoming shareholders,
are empowered to supply the mines with timber,
candles,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> gunpowder, and other articles which
are required for its working.</p>

<p>Having thus considered the mode in which the
ore is excavated from the mine, and brought to
the surface, let us examine the processes
which it ultimately assumes the state of marketable
metal.</p>

<p>The Tin ore is first <i>spalled</i>, as it is termed,
that is, broken into smaller fragments, and separated
from the worthless parts; it is then pounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in the <i>Stamping mill</i>,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> an operation which is
essential to the complete separation of the oxide
from the hard matrix through which it is disseminated:
if full of slime it is first thrown into
a pit called a <i>buddle</i>, where it is worked in order
to render the <i>Stamping</i> more free, and to prevent
it from choaking the grates; if however it is free
from slime, the ore is shoveled into a kind of
sloping canal of timber, called the <i>Pass</i>, whence
it slides by its own, weight, and the assistance of
a small stream of water, into the box where the
<i>Lifters</i> work; the <i>Lifters</i> are raised by a water
wheel, and they are armed at the bottom with
large masses of iron weighing nearly two hundred
weight, which pound or <i>stamp</i> the ore small
enough for its passage through the holes of an
iron grate fixed in one end of the box, a rill of
water carries it by a small gutter into the <i>fore
pit</i>, where it makes its first settlement, the lighter
particles running forward with the water into
the <i>middle pit</i>, and thence into the third, where
what is called the <i>slime</i>, or finest portion, settles;
from these pits the ore is carried to the <i>Keeve</i>,
which is a large vat containing water, in which
it is farther purified by an operation called <i>tozing</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and which consists in stirring the water round
by means of a small shovel, with such velocity
as to keep the <i>tin stuff</i> in a state of suspension,
until the whole quantity which can be managed
by one operation is thrown into the vat, and when
the <i>Tozer</i> slackens his efforts, the Tin subsides
to the bottom, from its greater specific gravity,
leaving the sand and other impurities at the top;
while this is going on the upper part of the vessel
is beaten with mallets for some minutes, in
order more effectually to ensure this separation.</p>

<p>A third process still remains to be described,
that of Dressing the sand on an inclined plain
with the assistance of a small stream of water; a
great degree of manual dexterity is here requisite;
the object, however, is effected with less
trouble and expense, and much more completely,
by the German "<i>Repercussion Frames</i>," of which
there is a model in the Geological Museum at
Penzance.</p>

<p>Upon the same mechanical principle of separation,
founded on the relative specific gravities of
the Tin oxide, and the earthy matters with which
it may be mixed, the Tinner is at once enabled
to estimate the value of any given sample of ore;
for which purpose the <i>Tin stuff</i> is placed on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
shovel, and washed under a stream of water,
until the impure earthy particles are carried off
from its sides, when by a peculiar and dextrous
motion, not easily described, all the particles of
the ore are collected together on the fore part of
the shovel. This operation is called <i>Vanning</i>.</p>

<p>When the Tin ore is contaminated with <i>Mundic</i>,
that is, with <i>Arsenical</i> and <i>Iron Pyrites</i>, it is first
roasted in the <i>Burning House</i>, and then washed;
by which means the Tin, which is heavy, is easily
separated from the other ores, which are comparatively
light. If any <i>Sulphuret of Copper</i> be present,
the same process is calculated to separate
it, by thus converting it into a <i>Sulphate</i>,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> as
described at page <a href="#Page_128">128</a>.</p>

<p>When the ore is dressed, the lord of the soil
receives that portion which is his due, after which
it is divided into as many <i>doles</i> or shares, as there
are adventurers; and these are measured out by
barrows, an account of which is kept, in the manner
of the old times, by a person who notches a
stick.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>
<p>The manner of dressing and cleansing <i>Copper</i>
ore is nearly similar to that of Tin, except indeed
that as it is raised in large masses, and is tolerably
pure, it does not generally require <i>Stamping</i>,
nor much washing.</p>

<p>All these different processes furnish employment
for a great number of women and children,
and it is really interesting to see the dexterity
and cheerfulness with which they pursue the occupation.
There is, however, one practice which
ought to be reformed&mdash;the burthen of the <i>Standard
Barrow</i> used in carrying Copper, and which is
said to contain three hundred weight; in addition
to which we must allow for the weight of the
barrow itself, and that of the water held by the
recently washed ore, so that it cannot be estimated
at less than four hundred weight. This is
an enormous burthen, which is borne by all descriptions
of persons who are employed in dressing
and weighing, and it has given rise to many
evils.</p>

<p>Those who work below have generally a
wretched and emaciated appearance, although
they seldom continue longer under ground than
six hours in the twenty-four, but are relieved by
a fresh corps. Pulmonary consumption may be
said to be the disease to which they are more
particularly liable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The names by which the Cornish mines are
distinguished are usually invented by the first
adventurers, and are often whimsical enough,
the usual prefix, <i>Huel</i>, (always pronounced, and
generally erroneously spelt, <i>Wheel</i>) signifies in
the Cornish language <i>a hole</i>; while the specific
name of the mine is taken from some trivial or
accidental circumstance, thus <i>Dolcoath</i> was the
name of an old woman, <i>Dorothy Koath</i>, who lived
upon the spot where the working of the mine
commenced; <i>Huel Providence</i> was so called from
the accidental way in which it was discovered;
and <i>Huel Boys</i> from the lode having been first
noticed by children who had been playing, and
digging pits in imitation of shafts.</p>

<p>By a rough calculation it may be stated that
there are about 130 mines in the county, but the
number is of course subject to variation; old
workings being frequently given up, and new
mines opened, or forsaken ones resumed.</p>

<p>Besides the mines, there are also "<i>Stream
Works</i>," which afford a large quantity of the
purest <i>oxide</i>.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> They occur in vallies, and derive
their name from the manner in which they are
worked; which merely consists in washing the
alluvial soil by directing a stream of water over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
it, when the finer particles being washed away,
the <i>Tin ore</i> is procured in a separate form.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The
process is termed <i>Streaming for Tin</i>. It is a
singular fact that the only traces of Gold to be
found in Cornwall<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> are in these alluvial depositions,
in which it sometimes occurs in small
grains, mostly detached, but occasionally adhering
to quartz. The miners engaged in the
stream works are generally prepared with quills,
into which they drop these particles as they find
them, and when the quill is full, it is carried to
the goldsmith for sale, and considered as a perquisite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is time for us to resume our topographical
descriptions&mdash;</p>

<p>In our road to Redruth we pass <i>Clowance</i> the
seat of Sir John St. Aubyn, Baronet. <i>Pendarves</i>
the residence of Edward William Wynne Pendarves,
Esq. son of the late John Stackhouse,
Esq. the elegant author of "<i>Nereis Britannica</i>,"
and <i>Tehidy Park</i>, the mansion of Francis Basset,
Lord de Dunstanville, &amp;c.</p>

<p>About two miles west of Redruth, is <span class="smcap">Dolcoath</span>,
a copper mine which every intelligent
traveller ought to visit, not only on account of
the immensity of the concern, and the ability and
liberality with which it is conducted, but because
it is so situated on the brow of a hill, that
the spectator can at one glance see all the principal
machinery by which it is worked. It is
quite impossible to convey an idea of this singular
and interesting scene;&mdash;Steam Engines;&mdash;Water
Wheels;&mdash;Horse Whims;&mdash;Stamping
Mills,&mdash;are all in motion before us, while in the
glen beneath us many hundred labourers are to
be seen busily engaged in the different operations
of separating, dressing, and carrying the ore.
The same stream of water pouring down the
hill turns successively numerous overshot wheels,
and serves various other purposes in its course;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and, having thus performed upon the surface,
all that ingenuity could devise, or the operations
of mining require, it is conducted into the bowels
of the earth, where, at a hundred and fifty feet
beneath its surface, it again turns an overshot
wheel of fifty feet in diameter, and becomes
again subservient to the skilful exertions of the
miner. In the whole circle of human inventions
there is nothing which so fully manifests the
resources of intellect, for the production of immense
effects, as the stupendous art of mining;
and it is impossible that the workings of Dolcoath
can be viewed without the strongest sensation
of wonder and exultation. The works of
the mine stretch upwards of a mile in length
from east to west; an extent of ground penetrated
by innumerable shafts, and honey-combed
by subterranean galleries. Upon the summit of
the hill is another rich copper mine, <i>Cook's
Kitchen</i>, which is on the same suite of lodes as
<i>Dolcoath</i>, but separated by a cross-course which
forms a natural boundary to both. This cross-course
has so <i>heaved</i> the lodes, that many which
are worked with great profit in the former mine
cannot be discovered in the latter, notwithstanding
the laborious search which has been made
for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The picturesque effect of this scenery is not a
little heightened by the bold elevation of <i>Carn-breh
Hill</i>, which, crowned with the mouldering
remains of past ages, rises, as if in mockery of
the boasted prowess of art, and forms a most
striking and impressive contrast to the active
scene before us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redruth</span> is a very populous town of high
antiquity, situated in the bosom of the mining
district, and capable of affording very excellent
accommodation to the mineralogist who may be
desirous of remaining some days for the purpose
of inspecting, at his leisure, the numerous mines
by which it is surrounded. The general level of
this metalliferous district is from 350 to 450 feet
above the sea; and being frequently intersected
by vallies, great opportunities are presented for
the advantageous construction of <i>Adits</i>.</p>

<p>We next proceed to visit the great Steam-Engine
of Chacewater mine, situated three
miles south of Redruth. It was erected about
the year 1813, and was at that period the most
powerful machine in the world. It is a double
engine upon the improved principle of Bolton
and Watt, and the style and elegance with which
its different parts are finished, reflect no inconsiderable
credit upon the engineer. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
are its dimensions; the cylinder is 66 inches,
the box 19, in diameter. The depth of the engine
shaft is 128 fathoms. From the <i>Adit</i> to the
bottom 90 fathoms. It makes eight strokes in a
minute, and at every stroke it raises 108 gallons
of water to the <i>Adit</i>;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and, at the same time
also, 60 gallons, 10 fathoms high, for the purpose
of condensing the steam. The quantity of coals
consumed in twenty-four hours is estimated at
about eight chaldrons. To give at once a popular
idea of its immense power, it may be stated
that, if it were applied as a mill, it could grind a
Winchester bushel of wheat every minute. Notwithstanding
the immensity of its force, and complexity
of parts, so completely is it under the
discretion and guidance of the engineer, that in
one instant he is able to stop its motions by the
mere application of his finger and thumb to a
screw.&mdash;"We put a hook in the nose of the
Leviathian;&mdash;play with him as a child, and take
him as a servant for ever."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>From Chacewater we proceed southward about
two miles to visit the extensive Copper mines,
called "<i>The Consolidated Mines</i>," the working of
which has been lately resumed. Here we shall find
two immense Steam Engines, with cylinders of
90 inches in diameter, constantly at work; the
interior of which is kept as clean as a drawing-room.
The capital expended in setting these
mines at work was not less than £65,000, and
under the arrangement of Mr. William Davey,
the concern has proved so profitable, that shares
are now selling in London at £100 per cent.
profit.</p>

<p>Near the <i>Consolidated Mines</i> are <i>Huel Unity</i>
and <i>Poldice</i>; the former is a Copper mine; the
latter produces both Copper and Tin. The most
beautiful specimens of <i>Arseniate of Copper</i>, and
<i>Arseniate of Lead</i> have been found in these
mines.</p>

<p>Having concluded our account of the mining
district, it remains for us to offer to the mineralogical
tourist a few observations upon the subject
of Cornish Minerals, and upon the best
method of procuring them; before the stranger,
however, attempts to purchase any specimens,
it will be well for him to inspect the several
splendid cabinets in the county; besides that in
the museum of the Royal Geological Society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
at Penzance, he should see those in the possession
of William Rashleigh, Esq. M. P. of <i>Menabilly</i>;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
John Williams, Esq. of <i>Scorrier House</i>,
and Joseph Carne, Esq. of <i>Penzance</i>. The one
in possession of Mr. Rashleigh, if not the most
accessible to the mineralogist, must be confessed
to be without comparison, the most splendid. Its
chief excellence consists in the magnificence and
variety of the <i>Oxide of Tin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> <i>Fluors</i>, <i>Malachite</i>,
and some of the rarer varieties of <i>Sulphuret of
Copper</i>, from mines which have long since ceased
to be worked. Among the more remarkable
specimens are those of <i>Oxide of Tin</i> (from Saint
Agnes) some of the more interesting varieties of
which present the following forms,&mdash;very large
octohedrons with, and without, truncations;&mdash;the
crystal described by Klaproth as one of the
rarest occurrence, <i>viz.</i>&mdash;the four-sided prism,
with a four-sided pyramid at each extremity;
this is to be seen in its simple form, and also
with a rich variety of truncations;&mdash;a group of
four-sided pyramids covered with a thin coating
of <i>Calcedony</i>, which, being <i>hydrophanous</i>, shews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the form of the crystal very distinctly after immersion
in water; <i>Wood-tin</i> forming a vein in
a matrix of quartz, to one side of which adheres
a fragment of rock; it is hardly necessary to remind
the mineralogist of the importance of this
specimen in a geognostic point of view;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Tin
crystals having a coating of black <i>hæmatite</i>;
<i>Sulphuret of Tin</i>, a mineral which has never
been found in any part of the world except at
<i>Huel Rock</i>, in Saint Agnes, <i>Stenna-gwyn</i>, in
Saint Stephen's, and <i>Huel Scorrier</i> in Gwennap.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
In the collection of Tins may be seen
several small blocks<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> of that metal, as prepared
by the Jews, for commerce, during the early
workings of the Cornish mines, among which is
a fraudulent one consisting of a mass of stone
covered with a thin coating of metal. In the
collection of Coppers may be noticed <i>Yellow</i>
<i>Copper ore</i> with <i>Opal</i> (from Roskeir); <i>the triple
Sulphuret of Antimony, Copper, and Lead</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
various forms; <i>Ruby Copper</i> in cubes; <i>Quartz</i>
containing globules of water; the <i>Hydrargyllite</i>
or <i>Wavellite</i>, in a plumose form accompanied by
<i>Apatite</i> in a matrix of Quartz (from Saint
Stephen's), <i>Topazes</i> of considerable lustre (from
Saint Agnes), <i>Green Fluor</i> in crystals of twenty-four
sides (Saint Agnes). A most beautiful and
instructive cube of <i>Fluor</i>, the surface of which
reflects a delicate green hue, but upon being held
to the light the crystal exhibits its octohedral nucleus
of a purple colour. The mineralogist should
also notice a superb octohedron <i>of Gold</i>, and a
mass of <i>Stalactitical Arragonite</i> from the grotto of
Antiparos. Before quitting Menabilly he ought to
visit the grotto, built in a beautiful and secluded
part of the grounds, near the shore in the port
of Polredmouth. It stands at the extremity of a
large grove, and is constructed with the finest
species of marble and serpentine, with brilliant
crystals, pebbles, and shells; its form is that
of an octagon, two of the sides of which are
appropriated to the door and window which
front each other, while the six remaining sides
form receptacles for minerals, four of which contain
specimens of ores found in the county, and
two are filled with organic fossils, polished agates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and jaspers; the intermediate spaces are occupied
by shells, coralloids, and various other substances.
The roof is composed of <i>Stalactites</i> of singular
beauty, and which produce a very striking effect
as they are seen through the roughly formed
arch which composes the entrance. In this grotto
are preserved two links of the chain which were
found in Fowey harbour by some fishermen in
the year 1776; they are of a triangular form,
incrusted with shells and corals, and are supposed
to have formed a part of the chain which
extended from tower to tower, for the ancient
defence of the harbour. Among the mineralogical
specimens in this place there is one of <i>Calcedony</i>
which deserves particular notice for its
beauty as well as magnitude. In the centre of
the grotto is a table inlaid with thirty-two polished
specimens of granite, all found in the
county of Cornwall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Cabinet of John Williams, Esq.</span> is
at Scorrier House, about two miles east of Redruth,
and may therefore be visited by the mineralogist
in the present excursion. This collection
stands unrivalled in the magnificence of its specimens
of <i>Red Oxide of Copper</i>, in octohedrons,
cubes, and capillary crystals; it also contains the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
finest specimens of <i>Arseniate of Copper</i> in very
perfect obtuse octahedrons;&mdash;a mass of <i>Uranite</i>,
which in size and beauty is superior to any specimens
ever discovered;&mdash;<i>Blende</i>, in octohedrons
and cubes;&mdash;<i>Native, and Ruby Silver</i>; and a
specimen of the <i>Muriate</i> of that metal (<i>Horn</i>
Silver) so well known for its value, that it may
be said to constitute one of the most interesting
objects in the collection. The <i>Arseniate of Lead</i>,
in six-sided prisms, a most beautiful mineral,
which was first analysed by Mr. Gregor, and has
been found only in <i>Huel Unity</i>, may be seen
in this cabinet in its most perfect forms.</p>

<p>The collection of Mr. Carne has been already
noticed in our account of Penzance, at <i>page <a href="#Page_31">31</a></i>.</p>

<p>In order to collect the various minerals of the
county the stranger must apply to the different
dealers,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> (<i>rapax et sordidum pecus</i>) and make the
best bargain he is able; he may also occasionally
purchase some good specimens of the miners at
the various mines he may happen to visit. In
his rambles we recommend him to visit Saint
Agnes, where are the <i>Trevaunance</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> and <i>Seal
Hole</i> mines, from which have been raised the
most beautiful specimens of crystallized Tin in
the world, accompanied occasionally with <i>Topazes</i>,
and twenty-four-sided <i>Fluor</i>. Here too
may be seen a geological phenomenon of considerable
interest,&mdash;the slate of the coast intersected
with <i>Porphyry Dykes</i>, Saint Agnes'
Beacon is also well worthy of observation; it is
an insulated eminence of a pyramidal form, entirely
covered with <i>debris</i>, and is composed of
<i>Slate</i>, although it rises 664 feet above the level
of the sea. Saint Agnes is the birth place of the
celebrated artist <span class="smcap">Opie</span>,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and the tourist may be
gratified by inspecting many of the earlier productions
of his pencil. But we now take our
leave of the Mineralogist, and shall attend the
Antiquary in order to inspect <i>Carn-breh hill</i>,
which rises a little to the south-west of Redruth, to
an elevation of 697 feet; its principal interest is
derived from the lucubrations of Dr. Borlase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
who regarded it as having been the grand centre
of Druidical worship, and he asserts that, in his
time, the remains of the monuments which were
peculiar to that priesthood were to be easily
recognized, such as <i>Rock Basins</i>; <i>Circles</i>; <i>Cromlechs</i>;
<i>Rock Idols</i>; <i>Karns</i>; <i>Caves</i>; <i>religious enclosures</i>;
<i>Logan Stones</i>; a <i>Gorseddau</i>, or place
of elevation, whence the Druids pronounced their
decrees; and the traces of a <i>Grove of Oaks</i>!&mdash;this
is all very ingenious and imposing, but is
there any rational testimony in support of such
an hypothesis? are there any just grounds for
considering the objects to which he alludes as the
works of art?&mdash;most certainly none, they are
unquestionably the results of the operation of
time and the elements, and have never been
formed by any agents except those which Nature
employs in the decomposition of granitic masses;
but the age of Antiquarian illusion is past; the
light of geological science dispels the phantoms
which the wizard fancy had created, just as the
rising sun dissolves the mystic forms which the
most common object assumes in twilight, when
viewed through the medium of credulity and superstition.
The <i>rock basins</i> of Antiquaries are
rounded cavities on the surface of rocks, and are
occasionally as spheroidal, internally, as if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
had been actually shaped by a turning lathe;
it was this artificial appearance which first suggested
the hypothesis concerning their origin,
and induced the Antiquary to regard them as
pools of lustration. Dr. Mac Culloch,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> however,
very justly observes, that their true nature is
very easily traced by inspecting the rocks themselves;
on examining the excavations they will
be always found to contain distinct grains of
<i>Quartz</i>, and fragments of the other constituent
parts of the granite; a small force is sufficient to
detach from the sides of these cavities additional
fragments, shewing beyond doubt, that a process
of decomposition is still going on under favourable
circumstances; these circumstances are the
presence of water, or rather the alternate action
of air and moisture; if a drop of water can only
make an effectual lodgement on a surface of this
granite a small cavity must be sooner or later
produced, this insensibly enlarges as it becomes
capable of holding more water, and the sides as
they continue to waste necessarily retain an even
and rounded cavity, on account of the uniform
texture of the granite. This explanation is sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
satisfactory; in addition to which it may
be further stated, that these very <i>basins</i> not unfrequently
occur on the perpendicular sides of
rocks,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> which at once excludes the idea of their
artificial origin.</p>

<p>The other grotesque and whimsical appearances
of rocky masses, such as "<i>rock idols</i>, <i>logan stones</i>,"
&amp;c. are to be explained upon the tendency which
granite possesses of wearing more rapidly on the
parts which are most exposed to the action of
the weather, as already explained at page <a href="#Page_104">104</a>.
There occurs upon the western part of the ridge
of <i>Carn-breh</i> an equipoised stone, about 20 feet
in diameter, affording a very singular illustration
of these views, and of which we shall here present
a sketch to our readers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_211.jpg" width="200" height="171" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus upon simple and philosophical principles
are such appearances to be easily explained, and
this <i>Phantasmagoria</i> of the learned antiquary
vanishes.</p>

<p>For the information of the Geologist who may
visit this spot, we shall state, that in a porphyritic
granite on the summit, Mr. W. Phillips has
lately discovered that some of the crystals formerly
considered as <i>Felspar</i>, were <i>Cleavelandite</i>;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
and we have little doubt that this curious discovery
might be extended to many of the granitic
masses in Western Cornwall.</p>

<p>At the eastern end of the hill is <i>Carn-breh
Castle</i>; the rocks upon which this building stands,
not being contiguous, are connected by arches
turned over the cavities; one part of the fortress
pierced with loopholes is evidently very ancient,
and is supposed to have been of British work;
the other is of modern construction, and was
probably erected as an ornamental object from
the grounds of Tehidy. There were formerly
some outworks to the north-west; and, near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
summit of the hill is a circular fortification called
the <i>Old Castle</i>, which appears to have been included
within a strong wall. The hill itself, on
which the spectator stands, is quite in unison
with the scene around him; its silence and desolation,&mdash;the
awful vestiges of its convulsion,&mdash;and
the immense rocky fragments which lie scattered
on its brow, are well calculated to harmonize
with an extended and barren tract of country,
every where broken up by mining operations,
and whose horizon is bounded by the ocean.</p>

of £84,000 in one year; and Huel Alfred, during the last
period of its working, yielded very nearly £130,000, after having
defrayed every necessary expense. The adventurers in Huel Vor
have lately gained £10,000 in three months. But, on the contrary,
how numerous are the losses, not perhaps corresponding in magnitude,
in any individual mine, to the gains which have been above
stated. In North Downs as much as £90,000 were lost, but this
is a rare instance.</p></div>

<h2>EXCURSION VI.</h2>

<div class="center">TO KYNANCE COVE, AND THE LIZARD POINT.</div>


<p>An excursion to the peninsula of the Lizard
offers to the scientific traveller many objects of
great geological interest; he will be enabled to
examine a very rare and important series of Rock
Formations, while their various gradations and
transitions into each other will afford ample materials
for speculation. In the course of this
excursion it will be our duty to point out some
of the more prominent features as they may occur
in our progress; but in performing this duty we
wish to be considered as merely presenting the
geologist with a rough and imperfect outline,
which may give a useful direction to his researches,
and enable him to acquire, through the
medium of his own observation, more ample and
perfect information.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>To the country south of a line drawn from the
mouth of the Helford river, on the east, to the
Loe-Bar on the west, has the appellation of the
"<i>Lizard District</i>" been exclusively applied by
Mr. Majendie; and the division appears to have
been conventionally received by all the geologists
who have traced his steps.</p>

<p>The fundamental rock of this peninsula appears
to be <i>Clay-slate</i>, associated with <i>Greywacké</i>, upon
which are successively deposited <i>Greenstone</i>,
<i>Diallage rock</i>, and <i>Serpentine</i>. At Marazion
several alternate beds of <i>Slate</i> and <i>Greenstone</i>
may be observed; the latter of which contains
<i>Asbestus-Actynolite</i>, and is universally traversed
by veins of <i>Axinite</i>,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> which occurs both in an
amorphous and crystalline form.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
<p>In the vicinity of a projecting ledge of rocks,
known by the name of <i>Cuddan Point</i>, stands a
mansion called <i>Acton Castle</i>, which was erected
as a marine residence by the late John Stackhouse,
Esq. and is at present occupied by Capt. Praed.
Its situation is wild and unsheltered, but it commands
a prospect of very extraordinary grandeur
and beauty.</p>

<p>About four miles from Marazion, and half a
mile from the high road towards the coast, are
the remains of a building called <i>Pengerswick
Castle</i>, a square stone tower, with a smaller one
annexed, and some ruins of walls, are all that
remain of this ancient edifice, but its machiolated
gate and embattled turrets are still preserved to
announce its military origin. The different
rooms are now converted into granaries, but the
oak wainscot, which is curiously carved and
painted, remains in a tolerable state of preservation.
On one of these panels, under a rude
representation of water dropping from a rock,
with the title "<i>Perseverance</i>," is the following
poetical inscription.</p>

<div class="poem">
"What thing is harder than a rock?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What softer is than water clear?</span><br />
Yet will the same with often drop<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hard rock pierce, which doth appear,</span><br />
Even so there's nothing so hard to attayne<br />
But may be had with labour and pain."<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The classical reader will at once recognise in
this inscription a paraphrase of the well known
lines of Ovid:</p>

<div class="poem">
"Quid magis est saxo durum,&mdash;Quid mollius unda?<br />
Dura tamen molli Saxa cavantur Aqua."<br />
</div>

<p>There exists a tradition that this place belonged
in the reign of Henry VIII. to one
Milliton, who having slain a man privately, purchased
the castle in the name of his son, and
immured himself in a secret chamber in the
tower.</p>

<p>On a bold pile of <i>Granite rocks</i> which projects
from the shore near Pengerswick, Dr. Maton
observed clusters of <i>Trochus crassus</i>, besides
some species of <i>Actinia</i> and <i>Asterias</i>, not common
on other parts of the coast. Pursuing our route
we pass through a country principally composed
of Slate, the great Granite chain running to the
left of the road, and constituting <i>Tregoning</i>,
<i>Godolphin</i>, and <i>Breage hills</i>. The Signal house
at the top of <i>Tregoning hill</i>, which is 584 feet
above the sea, constitutes the most elevated point
in the country, and from which both channels
are visible. The granite of this hill bears in
some parts all the appearance of a stratified
rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon arriving at the village of <i>Breage</i>, three
miles west of Helston, the traveller should turn
off from the high road, in order to visit the Tin
Mine called <i>Huel Vor</i>, and which lies about a
mile and a half to the north-east, and is by far
the largest as well as the richest Tin Mine ever
worked in Cornwall. Here there are five large
Steam Engines for drawing the water out of the
mine, besides several others for raising the ore.
There are also four large Stamping Mills, worked
by Steam, which constitute by far the most
interesting part of the machinery. It is not many
years since steam was first applied as the moving
power of these mills, but without its aid it would
have been impossible to stamp the whole of <i>Huel
Vor</i> Tin with sufficient expedition. In this mine
all the operations are carried on which have been
already described in our excursion to Redruth,
and the Mining Districts. The ore is also roasted
and smelted on the spot. Here then the stranger
may witness the whole process, from the period
when the ore is broken in the vein, to that when
the pure Tin runs out of the furnace, and is
laded into moulds which contain about 370
pounds. The principal Tin <i>lode</i> in this mine is,
in one part, of the enormous width of 30 feet,
and is so rich withal, that the adventurers lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
gained a clear profit of upwards of £10,000, in
the space of three months. The workings extend
for more than a mile and a quarter under ground,
and about thirteen hundred persons are engaged
in conducting its operations.</p>

<p>On the Coast, about three miles west of Helston,
is Portleven harbour; notwithstanding the
enormous sum of money which has been expended
in completing this work, we believe that it is
never likely to answer the object for which it
was projected; the fact is simply this, that at
those times when the severity of the weather
renders such a refuge desirable to the navigators
of the Mount's Bay, the sea sets in with such
tremendous force upon this part of the coast that
it is absolutely unsafe for any vessels to approach
it, and still more so to attempt a passage into the
basin, through its narrow entrance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helston</span> is a large and populous town, containing
nearly 3000 inhabitants, situated on the
side of a hill which slopes gradually to the little
river <i>Cober</i>. The houses are chiefly disposed in
four streets in the form of a cross, and, at the
point of intersection, stand the market house and
town hall. The church, which was erected A.D.
1762, at the sole expense of the then Earl of
Godolphin, stands on an eminence to the north,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and forms a very pleasing object from the valley
below, while to the tempest tossed mariner it
serves as a useful landmark.</p>

<p>Helston has returned members to Parliament
ever since Edward I., being one of the five
ancient boroughs of Cornwall. There was formerly
a castle, on the site of the present bowling
green, but of which no vestige remains. The
town is now lighted by means of gas.</p>

<p>In this town we shall be gratified to find the
traces of an ancient custom, which the Antiquary
has been anxious to trace to so high a source as
the Roman <i>Floralia</i>, a festival observed by that
people, in honour of the Goddess Flora, on the
fourth of the Calends of May. It is called the
<i>Furry</i>, and it is said that its present name alone
would discover its origin, were it not satisfactorily
pointed out by the time of its celebration.
We confess ourselves to have been amongst the
happy number<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> who regarded the annual festival
of Helston as a faint trace of the Roman <i>Floralia</i>
which the abrasion of fourteen centuries had not
wholly obliterated. But the evil genius of Reality
has at length appeared to dispel the illusion,
and to extort from us the unwilling belief that it
can be no other than the anniversary of a victory,
obtained by the natives over an invading enemy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>The morning of the <i>Eighth of May</i> is ushered
in with the sound of drums and kettles, when the
streets are soon thronged with spectators, and
assistants in the <i>Mysteries</i>. So strict is the observance
of this day as a general holiday, that
should any person be found at work, he is instantly
seized, set astride on a pole, and hurried
on men's shoulders to the river, where, if he
does not commute his punishment by a fine, he is
sentenced to leap over a wide place, which he of
course fails in attempting, and falls into the
water, to the great amusement of the spectators.
At about the hour of nine the revellers appear
before the Grammar school, and make their demand
of a prescriptive holiday, after which they
collect contributions from house to house. They
then <i>fadé</i> into the country (<i>fadé</i> being an old
English word for <i>go</i>), and about noon return
with flowers and oak branches in their hats and
caps; from this time they dance, hand in hand,
through the streets, preceded by a violin,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> playing
an ancient traditional tune, the music of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
which we shall here introduce.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_222.jpg" width="600" height="311" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There is also a traditional song which is sung
in chorus, involving the history of Robin-Hood,
whose connection with the present festival it is
not easy to understand.</p>

<p>Upon this occasion it is a right, assumed from
time immemorial, for the persons engaged in the
dance to enter and run through any house they
please, without molestation.</p>

<p>The higher classes of the inhabitants having,
with much good humour, assisted in the rites of
the day, and performed their <i>exforensic</i> orgies,
resort to the ball room, where they are usually
met by the neighbouring families, and by those
strangers who may happen to be in this part of
Cornwall. The merry dance is commenced at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
an early hour, and generally protracted to the
dawn of the ensuing day.</p>

<p>Long may this harmless and innocent festival
continue to animate the blythe and young, on
each annual return of its celebration;&mdash;Its classic
spell may be dissolved, but the Temple of Hilarity,
consecrated by the smiles of Cornish youth
and beauty, needs not a Roman goddess for its
sanction.</p>

<div class="poem">
Why ask where the Flora derives its gay birth!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why each smiling brow wears its garland to-day?</span><br />
Enough that our sires kept it sacred to mirth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their children have hearts all as fervent as they.</span><br />
<br />
And yet might we trace where his ashes are laid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who first made the <i>Fadé</i> to sound in our bowers,</span><br />
To-day round his cromlech the dance should we braid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the fairest of Hellas<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> enwreath it with flowers.</span><br />
<br />
And hallow'd for aye be their place of repose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who their race have enrich'd with a dowry so rare,</span><br />
A spell&mdash;that yet brightens each year as it flows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With one gleam of Eden&mdash;a day free from care.</span><br />
<br />
Then join we the Dance! to their mem'ries of yore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let the mirth which they lov'd be the homage we pay.</span><br />
And the strain that inspir'd them long ages before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wake the joys, which they felt, in our bosoms to-day.</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>About two miles from Helston is <i>Penrose</i>, the
seat of John Rogers, Esq. situated in the midst
of a finely wooded scene, and on the border of a
large sheet of water called the <i>Loe Pool</i>; this
forms one of the most considerable lakes in the
county, and is produced by a very singular operation
of nature,&mdash;the continual rolling of the
waves of the British Channel towards the shore
forces in a vast quantity of sand and pebbles,
which, by constant accumulation, at length forms
a very high bank extending across the valley,
from hill to hill, and by closing up the mouth of
the channel occasions the river to spread its
waters over an area of nearly seven miles in circumference.
This bar of gravel cannot be passed
over by the waves of the highest tides, even
during the excitement of a storm, unless it be
attended with a very rare combination of circumstances.
The water of the lake gradually finds
its way through the gravel of the bar by slow
filtration; but in wet seasons, as it cannot pass off
with a rapidity equal to its influx, the lake will
often rise ten feet higher than its ordinary level.
This produces the singular effect of stopping two
mills, one on the <i>Loe</i>, the other on a lateral
stream, their wheels being at this time partly under
water. When this occurs the millers present
the Lord of the Manor with two leathern purses,
each containing three halfpence, and solicit his
permission to open a passage through the bar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
This being of course granted, the Mayor of Helston
engages workmen to carry the work into
effect. In a few days, however, the bar is again
filled up as before.</p>

<p>The <i>Loe Pool</i> abounds with a peculiar trout,
and other fresh-water fish. On its banks the
Botanist may gather <i>Corrigiola Littoralis</i>.</p>

<p>In proceeding to the Lizard Point, which is
about fourteen miles distant from Helston, we
shall examine the line of coast south of the Loe
bar. The interior of this peninsular region has
an aspect of dreary and barren uniformity, and
when viewed from the high granite ridge near
Constantine, it appears like a table land elevated
some hundred feet above the level of the sea,
presenting hardly any indication of rupture or
contortion throughout the whole extent of its
outline. The view of the same region from the
western shore of the Mount's Bay is still more
striking and characteristic; the upper surface
seems so exactly horizontal, that one might almost
be led to conjecture, that every projecting
ledge had been planed down until the promontory
resembled a great artificial terrace.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>Near <i>Gunwalloe Cove</i> the geologist should notice
the singularly contorted appearance of the
slaty rock, which continues as far as a small cove
north of <i>Mullion</i>, called <i>Bolerium</i>, where it
runs under a <i>Greenstone</i> composed of <i>Hornblende</i>
and <i>Compact Felspar</i>. The <i>Greenstone</i> prevails
through the whole of this district, and appears to
pass by a slow gradation into <i>Serpentine</i>, under
which it lies, as may be distinctly seen near the
south side of <i>Mullion Cove</i>.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> A small quantity
of <i>Diallage</i> is occasionally present in this rock,
but the predominant ingredient is common <i>Hornblende</i>;
and where this latter substance greatly
predominates over the <i>Felspar</i>, it in some places
assumes an earthy appearance and decomposes
into a kind of <i>Clay</i>, which is used in the neighbourhood
with excellent effect as a top dressing
for grass lands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Serpentine</i> is the next formation which we discover in
our progress, and is that which confers
such singular interest upon this part of the county,
since it occurs in no other part of England.
This beautiful rock derives its name from the
variegated colours and spots, supposed to resemble
the speckles of a serpent's skin; it is principally
of a dark green or brown, suffused with
shades of red. It occupies not less than one-third
of the area of the peninsula; the whole
extent of <i>Goonhilly downs</i> rests on it. Its boundary
is easily traced, says <i>Mr. Sedgwick</i>, by the
brown scanty vegetation with which its surface is
imperfectly covered; and the Professor might
have added, by the growth of that beautiful
heath, the <i>Erica Vagans</i>, for so congenial and
essential would a Magnesian soil appear to
its production, that notwithstanding its immense
profusion on the downs, not a single specimen
is to be found beyond the line which defines
the boundary of the <i>Serpentine</i> formation, nor is
it to be seen in any other part of England.
<i>Genista Anglica</i> is also to be found on these
downs.</p>

<p>About three miles south of Mullion, close to
the shore, is the celebrated <i>Steatite</i>, or <i>Soap
Rock</i>, which appears to run in veins<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> in the Serpentine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
although Dr. Thomson is inclined to
consider it as Serpentine itself in a state of decomposition.
When it is first quarried it is soft,
but by exposure to air it gradually hardens, although
it never loses that peculiar <i>soapy</i> feel
which characterises it. Dillwyn &amp; Co. of Swansea
have, at present, the works in their possession, by
paying to the proprietor, Lord Falmouth, a certain
annual sum. Its value in the manufacture
of China depends upon its infusibility, and the
property it possesses of retaining its colour in
the heat of the furnace; the first quality is to be
explained by the total absence of lime in its
composition, the latter by the very small proportion
of metallic matter contained in it. There
is, moreover, another purpose which it serves,
depending upon the peculiar property of <i>Magnesian
earth</i> in preventing that degree of contraction<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
which always occurs in the fire when
<i>Alumina</i> and <i>Silica</i> are alone made use of. Near
this spot veins of <i>Native Copper</i> may be frequently
seen at low water during spring tides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and a mass of this metal was once raised which
weighed 104 pounds. Copper is the only metallic
substance that has been found in any quantity
in the Serpentine formation; and this has never
occurred except <i>native</i>, as in the above instance,
or in the state of <i>Green Carbonate</i>, so that the
mining adventurer need not anticipate much advantage
from it.</p>

<p>About a mile farther south is <span class="smcap">Kynance Cove</span>,
justly celebrated as one of the most interesting
and extraordinary spots on the coast; the descent
into it is extremely steep, and overhung with
frowning crags; the cove itself is formed by a
numerous assemblage of Serpentine rocks of a
dark colour, and which exhibit a beautiful polish
from the constant attrition of the waves at high
water; in one part, these groups are so singularly
disposed as to open a fine natural arch into
a grotto, which penetrates deeply into the cliff;
the largest of these pyramidal masses is termed
the <span class="smcap">Asparagus Island</span>, from its being the
habitat of <i>Asparagus Officinalis</i>. One of the
rocks in this cove exhibits a very curious phenomenon
whimsically called the <span class="smcap">Devil's Bellows</span>;
there is a very deep chasm, through which
the sea rushes like a water spout, preceded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sub-marine rumbling, as loud as thunder; a flowing
tide, accompanied with a swell of the waves,
seems to be essential for the production of this
effect. De Luc offers the following explanation
of the phenomenon: "In the rock there is a
succession of caverns, into which the agitated sea
rushes by some sub-marine passage, and being
dashed and broken against their sides, a large
quantity of air<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> is thus disengaged from them,
which becoming highly compressed, and not
being able to escape beneath, in consequence of
the perpetual entrance of the waves, is forced to
pass with great violence and noise from cavern
to cavern, until it forces itself, together with a
column of water, through the opening above."
Amongst these beautiful rocks may be seen <i>Diallage</i>
of a brown colour; <i>Jade</i>; <i>compact Felspar</i>,
or <i>Saussurite</i>; and <i>Asbestus</i>. <i>Dykes of Felspar
Porphyry</i> are also to be observed in this spot.
It is hardly necessary to inform the geological
tourist that, in order to view this interesting
scene to his satisfaction, he must contrive to
arrive at a period near that of low water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>On the summit of the hill above this cove the
Botanist will observe <i>Geranium Sanguineum</i>
spreading itself in broad tufts. <i>Campanula Rotundifolia</i>
also occurs here.</p>

<p>Continuing our route towards Cape Lizard,
we shall perceive that the <i>Serpentine</i> terminates
about half a mile before we reach it, and is succeeded
by <i>Micaceous Slate</i>, under which, at the
Lizard head lie alternate beds of <i>Compact Felspar</i>,
containing specks of <i>Hornblende</i> and <i>green
Talc</i>. There are two light-houses at this point
which front the south, and stand nearly abreast
of each other, but unhappily they are too often
found to be insufficient securities against the
darkness of the midnight storm, and the treachery
of the sunken rocks with which this stern coast
is beset. Foreign pilots, unacquainted with its
perils, seldom keep the necessary distance from
the shore, and from the steepness of the rocks no
kind of assistance can be afforded to the mariner
from the land.</p>

<p>On a low hedge under the light-houses is to be
found <i>Herniaria Glabra</i>. It was here in the pursuit
of this very plant that a well known Botanist,
during the late war, was seized as a spy by the
suspicious natives, and carried to Helston for
examination. The increased intercourse, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
with scientific travellers, will render the
recurrence of such an event impossible.</p>

<p>The name of the promontory was most probably
derived from the striking <i>contour</i> which it
exhibits when viewed from sea, resembling the
elongated and compressed form of the Lizard;
at the same time it must be observed, that the
colour of its rocks resemble also that of the animal
to which we allude, while the British words
<i>Lis-ard</i> signify a lofty projection; these are extraordinary
coincidences, and are well calculated
to fan the flame of etymological controversy.</p>

<p>If after visiting this promontory, the traveller
feels inclined to trace the different rock formations,
and to complete his geological survey of
the Lizard <i>Chersonesus</i>, we recommend him to
return by a circuitous route along its eastern
coast. <i>Greenstone</i> reappears about half a mile
east of the Lizard Point, and continues for some
distance, with the occasional interruption of Serpentine,
which dips towards the sea. This latter
rock will be found best adapted for &oelig;conomical
purposes at the <i>Balk Hill</i>, <i>Landewednock</i>, but
it is certainly far inferior to that worked for
chimney pieces, columns, &amp;c. from the quarries
in the Isle of Anglesea. Near <i>Cadgwith</i> the rocks
on the coast form a very interesting and extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
amphitheatre, which is termed by the
inhabitants the <span class="smcap">Frying Pan</span>, although the appellation
of <span class="smcap">Cauldron</span>, which it strongly resembles,
would be much more appropriate. Its
sides are nearly two hundred feet in height,
and, at high water, the sea enters it and boils
up through an arch near its bottom. In this
spot the position of the <i>Serpentine</i> upon <i>Greenstone</i>
is very apparent. Beyond <i>Cadgwith</i> the
<i>Serpentine</i> assumes a dark green colour, and
contains small masses of the emerald green <i>Diallage</i>,
or <i>Schiller-spar</i>; whence it continues to
constitute the coast round the <i>Black Head</i> to
<i>Coverack Cove</i>. About a mile from the coast at
<i>Gwenter</i>, the rock denominated by Abbe Haüy
"<i>Diallage Rock</i>" (<i>Gabbro</i>) presents itself to
our notice; it is composed of <i>Saussurite</i>, or <i>Compact
Felspar</i>, and <i>Diallage Metalloïde</i>. In a
quarry near this spot it may be seen to join
<i>Serpentine</i>. In the <i>Diallage Rock</i>, at a small
village near the coast called <i>Gwendra</i>, as well
as in the rock of <i>Saint Keverne</i>, Mr. Majendie
discovered some small metallic specks, which he
found on chemical examination to consist of
Iron, with a portion of <i>Titanium</i>. Some of the
same substance was immediately transmitted to
Mr. William Gregor, who stated that the results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of his experiments proved it to be an assemblage
of several ingredients, <i>viz</i>. <i>Silica</i>, <i>Alumina</i>, and
the <i>Oxides of Iron</i> and <i>Titanium</i>, with a little
<i>Potass</i>. Some of which ingredients were no
doubt derived from the <i>gangue</i> with which the
metallic substance is intimately mixed. This is
a discovery no less curious than important, and
would seem to point out the origin of the <i>Menachanite</i>,
in which <i>Titanium</i> was first discovered
by Mr. Gregor.</p>

<p>The great mass of <i>Serpentine</i> ends at <i>Coverack
Cove</i>, a spot which well deserves the attention
of the Geologist, as offering a series of rocks of
a very mixed character; these consist of green
and reddish-brown <i>Serpentine</i>, with the <i>Jade</i> of
Saussure, (the <i>feldspath tenace</i> of Haüy) and
<i>Diallage</i><a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> of the green and metalloïde varieties;
some of the <i>Felspar</i> found here is of a violet
colour, and is striated like that of Labrador.
In beds which lie below high-water mark in
this Cove the mineralogist may obtain masses
of <i>Diallage Metalloïde</i>, six or eight inches in
length.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
A beautiful rock succeeds and continues
for three miles along the coast to the
<i>Manacles</i>; and in the interior of the country it
predominates through the greater part of the
parish of <i>Saint Keverne</i>. It has <i>compact Felspar</i>
for its base, in which are imbedded crystals both
of <i>Diallage</i> and <i>Hornblende</i>. In the proportion,
as well as the magnitude of these constituents,
says Mr. Professor Sedgwick, there is such an
unusual variety, that we were almost led to
conjecture, that during the deposition of the
mass many conflicting principles had been in
action, not one of which was long able to keep
the mastery over the others; there are for instance
many large blocks which in one part
resemble a fine <i>Greenstone</i>, and in another, a
coarse porphyritic <i>Diallage Rock</i>; within the
distance of a few feet these varieties may be
observed to alternate repeatedly, sometimes in
the form of stripes, but more frequently in amorphous
concretions separated from each other by
lines which are perfectly defined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> <i>Schistose
Greenstone</i> occurs again at <i>Porthowstock</i>, and a
small bed of <i>Serpentine</i>, on the south-west side
of <i>Porthallo</i> in the cliff, which rests on a reddish
<i>Talc</i> which lies, as before, on <i>Clay-slate</i>. No
other variety is observable from hence to the
Helford River, except in the appearance of a
<i>Pudding Stone</i>, or <i>Conglomerate</i>, near the <i>Dennis
Creek</i>, composed of rounded fragments of Slate
in which veins of <i>Quartz</i> are distinctly visible.
The traveller will not fail to visit the stream of
<i>Tregonwell Mill</i>,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> near the village of <i>Menacchan</i>,
celebrated as the habitat of the <i>Titaniferous Iron</i>
(<i>Menacchanite</i>, or <i>Gregorite</i>) discovered by the
late celebrated Mr. William Gregor.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> He will
also receive much gratification by extending his
route to <i>Mawnan</i> Cliffs, where he will observe
a most extraordinary intermixture of fine and
coarse grained (<i>Grawacke?</i>) slate, which are
traversed by many contemporaneous veins, some
composed of <i>Quartz</i>, and others of <i>Ferriferous</i>
<i>Carbonate of Lime</i>; some small cavities are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
coated with fine spicular <i>Arragonite</i>, and a much
rarer substance, which on a chemical examination
by Mr. Gregor proved to be a <i>Sub-carburet
of Iron</i>, has been found in thin plates among
the laminæ of the Slate. The Reverend John
Rogers has also obtained from this spot small
octohedral crystals of the <i>Yellow Sulphuret of
Copper</i>.</p>

<p>From a general review of the phenomena developed
in the present excursion, Mr. Professor
Sedgwick is led to conclude, that the <i>great Plateau
of the Lizard is not composed of stratified
rocks</i>, for although some obscure indications of
an order of super-position appear near <i>Coverack</i>
and <i>Porthalla</i>, yet he considers them as being
too uncertain to be opposed to the clear evidence
offered to the south-eastern parts of the coast,
where the alternating masses of <i>Greenstone</i> and
<i>Serpentine</i> so often appear, like great wedges
driven side by side into the escarpment, without
any arrangement whatsoever. Mr. Majendie,
however, who, be it known, actually <i>bivouacked</i>
in this district for a week, was satisfied that the
<i>Greenstone</i> and <i>Serpentine</i> did exhibit characters
of Stratification.&mdash;But we desist&mdash;feeling what
no doubt our readers have likewise experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the dry and uninviting nature of Geological
details.&mdash;Having therefore completed the task
we assigned ourselves, and conducted the traveller
to the more prominent and interesting
objects of <span class="smcap">Western Cornwall</span>, we take our
leave. The Agriculturist, the Antiquary, the
Botanist, the Geologist, and Mineralogist, must,
each in his turn, have received ample gratification
and instruction from his visit to this interesting
and important district of the British
Empire, while the Capitalist must have seen
from the agriculture, the mineral treasures, the
fisheries, and the commerce of the country, how
many, and what great opportunities are presented
for the advantageous exercise of capital;
the Valetudinarian too has, as we sincerely hope,
derived his share of benefit from the excursions,
and felt the salutary influence of those mild and
genial breezes which clothe our fields with perpetual
verdure, and impart to our cottagers the
enviable blessing of <span class="smcap">Health</span> and <span class="smcap">Long Life</span>.</p>

in the first volume of our Transactions, observes that "the
nature and origin of the veins of <i>Steatite</i> in Serpentine are curious
subjects of inquiry. Were they originally crystallized, and the
result of chemical deposition? Or have they been, as for the most
part they are now found, mere mechanical deposites, I am inclined
to the last opinion. The <i>Felspar</i> in Serpentine is very liable to
decompose, probably from the action of Carbonic acid and water
on its Alkaline, Calcareous, and Magnesian elements; and its parts
washed down by water, and deposited in the chasms of the rocks,
would necessarily gain that kind of loose aggregation belonging to
Steatite."</p></div>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<div class="center space-above">PART I.<br />
<br />
A DIALOGUE
<br />
</div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Between Dr. A.&mdash;a Physician, and Mr. B.&mdash;an
Invalid, on the comparative merits of different
Climates, as places of Winter residence.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="center space-above">
"Ne quis <i>error loci</i> nascatur&mdash;"
</div>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i>&mdash;In a conversation which we held together
in the early part of the summer, you will remember the
promise you then gave of affording me such advice,
relative to the choice of a winter's residence, as the
declining state of my health might require. The
autumn is now rapidly advancing, and I feel that no
time should be lost in making such arrangements as
may enable me to pass the approaching winter with the
greatest prospect of benefit.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i>&mdash;I fully acquiesce in the propriety of your
resolution, and shall readily afford you any information
in my power; but you well know that to a physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
there is not a question which he approaches with so
much diffidence, or dismisses with such little satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i>&mdash;I am well aware of the difficulties to which
you refer; circumstances of a moral nature, with which
the physician can rarely become sufficiently acquainted,
must necessarily have considerable weight in directing
the decision; but in my own case it is fortunate that
no such embarrassment can impede your judgment.
My only object and care is the restoration of health,
and my means are sufficient to enable me to pursue it
in any way which may give the fairest promise of
success.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i>&mdash;You mistake me, it was not to embarrassments
of that kind that I was alluding.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i>&mdash;Can then any other source of difficulty
exist? To a medical practitioner who is in the habit
of sending his patients to all parts of Europe in search
of health, the real and comparative advantages of each
locality must surely be well known.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i>&mdash;Far otherwise, my dear friend; there are
few subjects upon which medical men have more widely
differed. It is true that we send our pulmonary sufferers
to various parts of the continent, and that we
receive from them a multiplicity of reports; but then
they are often totally at variance with each other upon
those very points which are generally considered as the
least questionable; and when we attempt to reconcile
this discordance, by an appeal to meteorological records,
and registers of prevalent diseases, we are mortified
to find that the evidence necessary for forming
a safe and practical conclusion, requires a union of
industry and accuracy which has not hitherto been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
found to exist in a sufficient number of collateral observers.
Nor must it be forgotten, that the disease,
for the cure of which the invalid is persuaded to emigrate,
may require a very different atmosphere in its
different stages and forms; and after all, how often does
it happen that the sufferer is not sent abroad, until every
chance of palliation has gone by.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i>&mdash;I do not hesitate to declare that such conduct,
on the part of a medical adviser, is as cruel as it
is unprincipled; my confidence however in your integrity
satisfies me that you will never abandon an
unhappy sufferer to such a useless alternative; I must
therefore request you to state your opinion, <i>generally</i>,
as to the peculiar conditions upon which you consider
the eligibility of a climate, in the cure or palliation of
pulmonary affections, to depend.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i>&mdash;This I shall do most cheerfully, especially
in conversation with one, whose philosophical pursuits
will have already instructed him in those principles,
from which our conclusions are necessarily deduced.&mdash;Congenial
warmth, and, above all, equability of temperature,
are the first objects of inquiry in the theoretical
comparison of climates; but these cannot be
<i>practically</i> ascertained, in relation to their effects upon
the human body, by the thermometer; because they
are constantly liable to be modified by causes of which
we have no other indication but that afforded by our
sensations.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i>&mdash;That is strange;&mdash;and, so gratuitous does
the assertion appear to me, that I should be better
satisfied were you to support it by some examples.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i>&mdash;Well then, I may instance for your satisfaction,
the well known influence of peculiar winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
combined with moisture, and which, although they
may produce little or no variation in the thermometer
will rapidly rob the body of its heat; the north-west
winds which so commonly blow in the southern provinces
of France are decidedly more mischievous to
the pulmonary invalid than the March winds that desolate
the more delicate frames in our own country,
and yet the thermometer in this case affords no indication
of their nature.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i>&mdash;No one who wishes to form a just estimate
of a climate, can doubt the propriety of taking the
prevalence of wind, and the degree of atmospheric
moisture into the account; although reasoning, from
analogy, I should not suppose that this latter circumstance
would be prejudicial; look at the moist and
foggy atmosphere of Holland, and yet I am told that
catarrhal affections are extremely rare in that country.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i>&mdash;Moisture must make both heat and cold
more sensible; the one, by diminishing perspiration,
the other, by increasing the conducting power of the
air;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> humidity therefore may be an injurious, or a
salutary condition, according to circumstances; but
you are greatly mistaken in supposing that the Dutch
owe their immunity from Catarrh to the dampness of
their climate, for it is to be imputed to the greater
equability of its temperature.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> You no doubt place great stress upon the
advantage of an equable climate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Dr. A.</i> I consider equability as the most important
condition of all; especially where the temperature ranges
at about 60° of Fahrenheit. It not only diminishes
the chance of aggravating pulmonary disease by preventing
Catarrhs, but it serves to preserve a genial and
regular action of the skin, to keep the balance of blood
constantly on the surface, and to prevent any undue
congestion of it in the lungs. Besides, it is acknowledged
on all sides, that consumption is most prevalent
in countries and districts which are subject to great and
rapid changes of temperature, and that it is comparatively
rare in those which are free from the diurnal
changes and sudden transitions which so characterise
that of our own island.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Nothing can be more convincing than such
reasoning;&mdash;but tell me for what reason you consider
the temperature of 60° as an essential condition under
these circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> It is evident that no climate, however equable
it may be <i>thermometrically</i>, can be considered as
such in a <i>medical</i> point of view, if its temperature ranges
much below the degree I have mentioned; because
in that case a material change must always occur whenever
the invalid quits his apartment, and goes into the
open air. So that I consider a cold climate must <i>in
effect</i> be always regarded as a variable one.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> But cannot this objection be obviated by
suitable cloathing?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> To a certain extent perhaps, but recollect if
you please, that there is no furnishing a great coat for
the lungs, to protect their structure against the diminished
temperature of the air which is breathed.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> What opinion have you formed respecting
the effects of a marine atmosphere?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> I apprehend that question cannot be fairly
answered without a reference to the symptoms and circumstances
of each particular case; generally speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
I am induced to consider the air of the sea as not hostile
to diseased lungs, except perhaps in those cases in
which Hectic fever is fully established; but then again
cases will sometimes occur which would appear to
sanction a contrary conclusion. Thus much I should
say was certainly true, that in such situations you will
always experience more humidity, and that when the
air is cold, that cold will in consequence be more intolerable,
for the reasons I have before stated. On the
other hand you must be aware that a marine situation
will enjoy a more equable temperature<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> than one similarly
situated, but remote from the ocean, and as far as
that goes it will have its advantages.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> I should much like to know what the continental
physicians think of this circumstance, with
reference to their own climate.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Upon that point you may be easily satisfied
by referring to Dr. Clark's work on foreign climates.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
He says that the physicians on the sea coast send their
consumptive patients into the interior, and those in the
interior to the shores of the Mediterranean or Adriatic.
From Genoa they send them into the interior, deeming
the sea air injurious to them. From Naples they frequently
send such invalids to Rome. From Rome, on
the other hand, they send them frequently to Cività
Vecchia, on the shores of the Mediterranean; more
frequently to the shores of the Adriatic, and, occasionally,
even to Naples!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> And is this account to <i>satisfy</i> me? why I
am plunged deeper in doubt than ever by such testimony.
No wonder that the physician should approach
the subject of Climate with diffidence when he finds
those best able, from experience, to appreciate its merits,
so irreconcileably at variance with each other. In
the next place, let me ask whether you advocate the
advantages of a Sea Voyage?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Not unconditionally. Dr. Young has said,
and I believe with much truth, that the greatest possible
equability of temperature is to be obtained in a sea
voyage to a warm climate; in which the variation will
seldom amount to half as much as in the most favourable
situation on shore, even on a small island.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> The very condition which, of all others,
you consider the most beneficial.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Undoubtedly, and if you can make interest
with Neptune to push you forward with his trident,
and persuade Æolus to slumber quietly in his caverns,
lose no time in availing yourself of such advantages;
but as long as the wind "bloweth where it listeth," I
entreat you, my good friend, to remain on <i>terra firma</i>;
depend upon it that experience will fully sanction this
advice;&mdash;of the great number of patients who have
been sent on such an errand, by far the greatest proportion
have had the progress of their pectoral complaints
rapidly accelerated during the voyage; remember
the various kinds of physical injury and distress to
which you must be exposed on board of ship, before
you can reach a steady and warm climate, from bad
weather, and different local causes which it is not necessary
to enumerate;&mdash;four and twenty hours beating to
windward are sufficient to counterbalance all the advantages
that might be anticipated.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Why you must surely have been inoculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
with the prejudices of Mr. Matthews, who tells us that
the fatigue and discomfort of a vessel is much the same
thing as being tossed in a blanket during one half of the
day, and thrown into a pigsty for the remainder.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> I never was more serious. If the weather
be bad the patient has but one alternative, he is either
half suffocated with smoke or an oppressive atmosphere
in the cabin, or exposed on deck to cutting winds, rain,
and cold, and to an air by far too free for diseased
lungs; then again sea sickness, whatever may have
been said to the contrary, reduces his strength rapidly,
and if damp sheets are the <i>bug-bears</i> of land travellers,
damp clothes of every description are unavoidable at
sea, and which in stormy weather can seldom be dried.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Well, you will at least allow that the motion
of a ship is preferable to that of a carriage on a rough
road.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> I will not even concede this point, and were
you only to read the interesting case of Dr. Currie, I am
sure that you would be soon convinced of the contrary.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> The opinion you have now expressed is sufficient;
I shall not be readily induced to make the
experiment of a sea voyage; suppose me then, if you
please, to have been already transported across the
channel on a calm day in a Steam-boat, and tell me to
what part of the continent I am to direct my steps, in
order to find a suitable residence for the winter months.
I take it for granted that you consider the English
Climate, from June to October as salutary to natives as
that of any country in the world.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Beyond question;&mdash;but as an invalid who
seeks permanent advantage from a foreign climate must
be content to remain abroad for, at least, two winters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
you will readily perceive that the consideration of his
residence during the summer season is not entirely a
subject of indifference.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> My inclination would lead me to the south
of France in preference to a more distant residence, provided
the place should meet with your full concurrence.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> The places to which English invalids have
been more usually sent are Montpellier, Marseilles,
Toulon, and Hieres; but I never ventured an opinion
with less reserve when I declare, that I regard the very
coldest parts of our own country to be less inimical to
delicate lungs than the sharp and piercing air of the
places which I have just mentioned. As to Montpellier,
I am at a loss to understand how it could ever have
obtained a reputation for its climate; and yet so universal
was the belief, that its very name became, as you
must well know, a characteristic epithet to places supposed
to be preeminently salubrious.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Is it not remarkable for its clear blue sky,
the very idea of which will always carry a charm with
it to an Englishman?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Clear and brilliant enough, but the air is at
the same time so sharp and biting, that every mouthful
irritates the lungs, and produces excessive coughing,&mdash;and
then you are, moreover, constantly assailed by one
or the other of two destructive winds,&mdash;the <i>Bize</i> bringing
cold, and the <i>Marin</i>, moisture.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> And yet to this same <i>Bize</i>, of whose sharpness
you so greatly complain, did the Emperor Augustus
erect an altar.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Very true, but we are told it was an homage
like that which the Indians are said to pay to the infernal
deity; to avert its wrath, not to conciliate its favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Is the locality of Marseilles less exceptionable?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> By no means. Cold winds are always injurious,
but they are rendered destructive, in a tenfold
proportion, when alternated with heat. At Marseilles
the dreaded <i>Mistral</i> of Provence (a north-west wind),
which is often accompanied by a clear atmosphere, and
a powerful sun, reigns in all its glory. Toulon has the
damning fault of Marseilles.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Is Hieres exposed to the same evil?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Not in the same degree. It has generally
the credit of being much milder, and I really believe
that it is justly preferred to every other place in Provence,&mdash;but
it is not free from the <i>Mistral</i>. Dr. Clark,
however, tells us that about the bases of the hills, there
are some sheltered spots, where the invalid might enjoy
several hours in the open air on almost every dry day,
but then there exists a difficulty in reaching them at
those times, when they would be most useful.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> I see plainly, that a residence in the south
of France would never realize my hopes of recovery;
perhaps Nice may be more likely to afford satisfaction?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Nice, as you probably know, was first
brought into vogue by our celebrated countryman, Dr.
Smollet, who resided there during two winters, and it
has been extolled by numerous writers since that period;
the northern blasts, which rage with such fury in the
south of France, are averted from this favoured valley
by the maritime alps. Dr. Smollet, in speaking of its
superior mildness, when compared with Provence, says,
"the north-west winds blew as cold in Provence as
ever I felt them on the mountains of Scotland, whereas
Nice is altogether screened from them by mountains."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> If I have been correctly informed, the
neighbourhood of Nice is on many accounts preferable
to the town itself.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> The suburbs of the '<i>Croix de Marbre</i>' have
been the favourite residence of the English, and indeed
on that account are not unfrequently called the '<i>Fauxbourg
des Anglois</i>'. This spot is situated immediately
beyond the river <i>Paglion</i>, which, descending from its
Alpine sources, washes the western extremity of the
town and falls into the bay of Nice.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> What accommodations are to be met with
at Nice?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> I have always understood that provisions
are both good and abundant; some of my patients,
however, have complained greatly of the bread as being
sour and ill tasted from the leaven. As to the other accommodations,
Dr. Clark says that they are also good,
making allowance always for the inconveniences which,
to an English family, are inseparable from foreign
houses, such as smoky apartments, ill provided fire
places, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Now state, if you please, the objections
that may be urged against Nice.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> In the commencement of the winter, this
valley is remarkably infested with mosquitoes, which
greatly annoy strangers, especially children. During
the months of November, December, and January, the
climate would seem to embrace all the qualities so
favourable to pectoral complaints, but the three following
months are by no means unexceptionable. Although
Nice be protected from the <i>Mistral</i>, yet in the spring
of the year it is infested with cold sharp winds from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
east, and north and south-east, which are highly mischievous
to the valetudinarian.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> It is clear then that he should quit Nice at
this season.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> That is not so easy as you may suppose, for
unless he leaves it by sea, he must not venture to depart
by any of the usual roads before the month of May; for
should he direct his route to Turin, he will have a very
rough and hazardous journey over the "<i>Col de Tende</i>,"
and may perchance be caught in a snow storm; if on
the other hand, he returns by France, he must cross the
"<i>Estrelles</i>," and expose himself to the cold winds of
Provence.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Well these are strong objections; but taking
into consideration all the advantages and disadvantages
of Nice, will not the former so greatly preponderate,
as to entitle it to the character it has long enjoyed as
an eligible <i>winter</i> residence for the consumptive?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> I fear that medical experience will not
sanction such a conclusion. Catarrhal affections are
frequent amongst the inhabitants, and it has been remarked
by those best able to investigate the subject,
that the progress of pulmonary disease is rather accelerated
than retarded by this climate. If you will allow
me, I will read a passage from a late work by Dr.
Carter, which places this subject in a very striking
point of view. "Notwithstanding the mildness of
Nice, it appeared to be of little or no service to persons
labouring under confirmed consumption; during
the winter I was there, I saw no instance of great
amendment, and I even doubted whether life was not
shortened in some instances by a residence there. Some
medical men were clearly of that opinion; and as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
interest should have led them to speak well of Nice,
they must have been pretty strongly impressed with the
conviction of its climate being hurtful to people in confirmed
Phthisis, before they could have been induced
to make this opinion public."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> This is discouraging; but is the testimony
of Dr. Carter supported by other authorities?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> By many others. Here is a work by Dr.
Clark, who is himself resident at Rome, and a physician
of great intelligence; he not only confirms the opinion
of Dr. Carter, but adduces that of Professor Foderé
who practised at Nice for more than six years, and who
in a conversation with Dr. Clark, made the following
strong observation. "There is one thing certain, Sir,
you may safely assure your countrymen, that it is a very
bad practice to send their consumptive patients to Nice."
M. Foderé moreover observed, that consumption in this
district is not, as in Switzerland, on the banks of the
Soane, and in Alsace, a chronic disease; but, on the
contrary, he has often seen it terminate in forty days;
he says that the physician of the countries just mentioned
would be quite astonished at the quickness with
which one attack of pulmonary hemorrhage succeeds
another, how readily the tubercles suppurate, and how
speedily the lungs are destroyed. He is even inclined
to believe that there exists, on the shores of the Mediterranean,
some source of evil not appreciable by
meteorological observations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Mr. B</i>. Enough of Nice. What of Pisa?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> You may perhaps remember that Mr. Matthews,
in his comparison of these two places, says,
"I believe that Pisa is the very best place on the continent
during the winter for complaints of the chest;
and Nice, of which I speak from good authority, is
perhaps the very worst. The air of the first, which is
situated in a low plain, is warm, mild, and muggy;
that of the second is pure, keen, and piercing."</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> To speak honestly, I entertain a very high
respect for Mr. Matthews as an intelligent and agreeable
tourist, but he is the very last authority upon
which I could repose my confidence, with regard to the
salubrity of a climate; his observations upon this head
are too fretful and petulant to afford satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> His remarks upon Nice and Pisa will certainly
justify the opinion you have formed; for there
does not exist such a striking difference in the climate
of these places as he has been induced to believe; although
the latter town is certainly milder than Nice,
and possesses the advantage of having good roads leading
to it from all parts of Italy, so that the invalid may
leave it with safety much earlier than he could Nice.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Are the spring winds less violent than at
Nice?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Scarcely. The site of the houses, however,
is better calculated to defend you from their influence.
On the northern bank of the Arno, there is a crescent
which faces the south, and is well protected from the
north winds; this situation ought always to be selected
by invalids who winter at Pisa.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> If I resolve to winter in Italy, I shall probably
prefer Pisa. I confess that I have received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
prejudice against Rome, as well as Naples, from the
reports of some friends who have lately returned from
those places; but I should be glad to hear your opinion
upon the subject.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Rome and Naples ought not to be named in
the same breath, unless indeed for the sake of contrast.
Rome possesses many points of excellence as a winter
residence, but as to Naples at this season, I would not
recommend an invalid, on any account, to try its climate:&mdash;conceive
the effects of a hot sun with a winter
wind of piercing bitterness! "<i>Vedi Napoli e po' mori</i>,"
says the proverb, and no wonder that it has received so
many illustrations from the English. Upon this one
point at least we must all concur with Mr. Matthews:
"If," says he, "a man be tired of the slow lingering
progress of consumption, let him repair to Naples; and
the <i>denouement</i> will be much more rapid."</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> But what of Rome&mdash;of the Eternal City?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> That vehemence of expression, my good
friend, betrays your polarity; in spite of your avowal I
see clearly that your wishes point to the ancient Mistress
of the world.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> You really mistake me;&mdash;depend upon it
that I shall undertake no pilgrimage but to the temple
of Hygeia.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Rome has, by far, too many temptations for
the invalid, and I confess that from the accounts which
I have received from my patients, I am unable to discover
any advantages equivalent to the risks.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> I am even told that the climate of Rome is
much colder than that of Nice in the winter.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> You have been rightly informed; in addition
to which, the streets are damp and chilly, and so variable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
in temperature, that there is not unfrequently a
difference of twenty degrees between one street and
another.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> In what then does its excellence consist?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> It is decidedly the best spring residence in
Italy. The air is much more moist than that of Nice;
and, at this season, it has the advantage of being less
liable to cold winds; although it must be confessed
that the <i>Tramontana</i> (a sharp northerly wind,) is sometimes
felt with considerable severity, but it does not
affect the human body like the dry cold winds of Provence.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> The prejudice which exists in my mind
against Rome has arisen from the circumstance of many
of my friends having suffered severely from head-ache,
during their residence there.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Upon that point, I fear my opinion will
rather strengthen than remove your prejudice. I have
no hesitation in stating, that the same complaint has
been frequently made to me; and even Dr. Clark, the
English resident physician, confirms the objection.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> And then come the frightful <i>Malaria</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> The stranger has nothing to fear from these
exhalations between October and the middle of May,
after which period I should not recommend any invalid
to protract his visit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Mr. B.</i> But suppose his object is to remain two
winters at Rome,&mdash;where is he to find refuge during
these intervals?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> In the vicinity of Rome there are many spots
which will furnish a very eligible residence during the
hot weather, such are Albano, Frascati, Tivoli, Castel
Gandolfo.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> After what you have said, I think it is
scarcely worth while for an invalid to encounter the
fatigues of so long a journey; but you have not yet
mentioned Florence.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Its climate is almost as changeable as our
own, and far more mischievous, as its Siberian winds
alternate with a temperature equal to that of our finest
days in spring. The summer, however, is delightful,
the heat being greatly tempered by the Apennines.
Bicchierai, an Italian Physician of eminence, used to
say, that he wondered how any body could <i>live</i> at Florence
in the winter, or <i>die</i> there in the summer.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Upon the whole you have presented me
with a very discouraging view of the Italian Climate;
and I have always understood that Lisbon is intolerable
to an Englishman from its filth.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Lisbon is out of the question: the character
of its climate may be summed up in a few words. Its
winter temperature is neither mild nor equable, and its
spring is remarkable for dense and cold fogs; and as to
what an Englishman calls comfort, there is not a city in
the world where it is so systematically neglected.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Suppose I wave the objections to a sea
voyage and set sail for Sicily?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> In that case you will undoubtedly find a
fine climate, superior in most respects to that of the
Italian continent. The winter and spring seasons are
remarkably mild, provided you select Palermo for your
residence; Messina is exposed to cold piercing easterly
winds from the mountains of Calabria.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> I have heard Catania well spoken of.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Its atmosphere is too sulphureous; in addition
to which every egress from the town is difficult
and unpleasant, owing to the lava from the Volcano.
But there is in my opinion an insuperable objection to
the Sicilian climate from the extreme heat of its summer,
from which the invalid cannot easily escape.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Well then, Malta.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Dr. Domeier, in his account of this climate,
tells us that the thermometer seldom varies in this
island more than 6° in the twenty-four hours, or stands
below 51°, even in the depth of winter: but then the
summer, which is protracted even to the month of November,
is extremely mischievous from its heat, the
force of which is severely felt in a country where there
is scarcely any visible foliage, the place of hedges being
universally occupied by stone walls.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Let me hear what you have to say with
respect to the other islands which have gained celebrity
for their climates, such as Madeira, the Bermudas,
Jamaica,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> You must be well aware that these places
are, generally speaking, beyond the reach of the ordinary
class of English invalids. Madeira has been
greatly extolled by Dr. Adams, who even ventures to
assert that in cases of consumption, if the patient does
not saunter away his time, after his physician has advised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
him to quit England, we may with certainty promise
him a cure. In the West Indies it is agreed by
all authors, that consumptive affections are almost unknown,
and that scrofula in all its forms is uncommon.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Would you recommend a residence in the
West Indies to a person who has free control over his
movements?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> If we may be allowed to draw any inference
from the qualities of a climate, as indicated by the thermometer,
or by its effects on the constitution of the
inhabitants, there can be but little doubt that a residence
in the Bermudas, in a temperate and sheltered
part of Jamaica, or in some other of the West India
Islands, would present every advantage, towards the
recovery of a consumptive patient, that climate alone
can bestow.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> I thank you sincerely, my good Sir, for the
patience and candour with which you have discussed the
subject of climate. I am fully sensible of the difficulties
with which it is encompassed, and of the utter impossibility
of expecting from medical advice a satisfactory
solution of the many problems which it involves. Every
invalid must, to a certain extent, rely upon his own
judgment; but before I finally decide upon the place
of my destination, allow me to trespass still farther upon
your patience, in order to learn whether, after all,
there be not some favoured spot in our own country,
where I might seek shelter from the approaching
season, and which would supersede the necessity of
travelling to a foreign land?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> I should say to a person, who had been
accustomed to the colder and more exposed parts of our
island, try the effects of some more genial situation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and such a change would be as likely to favour convalescence
as an emigration to the continent; for although
by such a step, he might not obtain an equally
favourable atmosphere, he would more than counterbalance
the difference by ensuring the advantages of
English comforts.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> And to what parts of England would you
direct him?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> There are particular spots on the coast of
Hampshire and Sussex which have been long considered
as eligible places of winter residence; such are Southampton
and Hastings, which are certainly less subject
to the effect of the Northern and Eastern winds than
many parts of our island; but they are not to be put in
competition with Sidmouth, Dawlish, or Torquay in
Devonshire, and still less with Penzance in Cornwall,
which, after all, is the only situation which can be
fairly said to possess any very material advantages from
the mildness of its winter. I speak this from well
grounded observation and experience. The Climate of
Penzance is unlike that of any other part of the island.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> I remember having received a favourable
impression with respect to the climate of that place,
from the perusal of a small work, entitled, a Guide to
the Mount's Bay and the Land's End; a copy was lent
me by Sir &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, and I have since endeavoured to
purchase one, but find that it is out of print.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Are you not aware then that you have been
conversing with its author?&mdash;The book has been for
some time out of print, but a second edition is nearly
ready for publication; and, with your permission, I
shall introduce, as nearly as my memory will serve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the conversation which we have just held together upon
the subject of Climate.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> By all means;&mdash;the questions which I have
submitted for your opinion, are such as must naturally
suggest themselves to every invalid who is in search of
a winter residence, and as your little work, as far as I
recollect, is intended for the same class of persons, its
practical utility will be materially enhanced by the
addition you have just proposed.</p>

<h3>
<i>An Account of the First Celebration of the</i><br />
KNILLIAN GAMES at <span class="smcap">St.</span> IVES.
<br />
Alluded to at page <a href="#Page_158">158</a> of this work.
</h3>


<p>We trust that our readers will find some amusement
and relaxation, after the fatigue of their day's excursion,
in the following <i>Jeu d'Esprit</i>, as originally written by
an eye witness of the festivity; an institution which,
adds the said writer, will go far to preserve the tone of
the Cornish character, and which can never be neglected
while the Cornish men continue to be brave, and
the Cornish women to be virtuous.</p>

<p>The celebration of the Games at Olympia, after the
revolution of every four years, formed the chief date of
time among the Greeks; and perhaps in future the inhabitants
of the West of England will reckon the years,
as they pass, by the quinquennial return of the games
at St. Ives.</p>

<p>I ought rather to have begun by stating, that John
Knill, Esq. a gentleman formerly of great eminence in
the above mentioned town, has bequeathed the income
of a considerable estate to be distributed by the trustees
in a variety of prizes to those who may excel in racing,
in rowing, and in wrestling. A large sum is to be
divided among a band of virgins, who are to be dressed
all in white, and with four matrons, and a company of
musicians preceding them, are to walk in pairs to the
summit of the hill, which is near the town of St. Ives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
where they are to dance and chaunt a hymn round the
far famed mausoleum.</p>

<p>Ten guineas are appointed to be expended in a dinner
at the grand hotel in the town, of which six of the
principal inhabitants are to partake; and this festival
is to be repeated every fifth year for ever.</p>

<p>From the earliest periods of history, the Cornish
have been famous for their enthusiastic fondness of the
athletic exercises of hurling, racing, wrestling, and
rowing, and for the pious fervour of the hymns which
the Druids instructed them to sing round the Cromlechs
of the departed brave.</p>

<p>By establishing rewards for superiority in amusements
in which the Cornish still delight to excel, Mr.
Knill has shewn the patriotic feelings of his local attachments;
while by the appropriate selection of the
spot where these pastimes are to take place, he has
given ample proof of the correctness of his taste. The
enormous statue of Jupiter at Elis pointed out that part
of Peloponnesus to the taste of the Greeks, as the most
proper place for the celebration of the Olympic Games;
and a sympathy of feeling and sentiment induced Mr.
Knill to order that the Mausoleum, which he erected
in the year 1782 should be the centre of the quinquennial
festivities. This proud pyramid, whose base is situated
on the summit of a rock, and whose apex is
often concealed among the clouds, has hitherto formed
only an object of ornamental magnificence, or a guide to
the tempest tost mariner; but henceforth it will be
regarded as the monument of fame&mdash;the pillar of the
west&mdash;the Cornish column!</p>

<p>Monday last was the day appointed for the first celebration.
I was present at the scene, and am induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to think, from this first specimen, that the rites of the
hill will be celebrated in succeeding years with increased
fervour and renewed admiration. Weak as my
powers of description are, your readers may, perhaps,
from the following account, conceive some idea of the
interesting spectacle.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the roads from Helston, from
Truro, and from Penzance, were lined with horses and
vehicles of every description. These were seen amidst
clouds of dust, pouring down the sides of the adjacent
mountains; while thousands of travellers on foot chose
the more pleasant route through the winding passages
of the vallies. At noon the assembly was formed. The
wrestlers entered the ring;&mdash;the troop of virgins dressed,
all in white, advanced with solemn step, which was
regulated by the notes of harmony. The spectators
ranged themselves along the sides of the hills which
inclose the extensive bay, while the pyramid on the
summit seemed pointing to the sun, who appeared in
all the majesty of light, rejoicing at the scene.</p>

<p>At length the Mayor of Saint Ives appeared in his
robes of state. The signal was given. The flags were
displayed in waving splendour from the towers of the
castle. Here the wrestlers exerted their sinewy strength;
there the rowers, in their various dresses of blue, white,
and red, urged the gilded prows of their boats through
the sparkling waves of the ocean; while the hills echoed
to the mingled shouts of the victors, the dashing of the
oars, the songs of the virgins, and the repeated plaudits
of the admiring crowd, who stood so thick upon the
crescent, which is formed by the surrounding mountains,
as to appear, if I may so express myself, <i>one
living amphitheatre</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The ladies and gentlemen of Penzance returned to an
elegant dinner which they had ordered to be prepared
at the Union Hotel; and a splendid ball concluded the
entertainment of the evening. The jolly god presided,&mdash;but
a reproving smile from Venus restrained him, if
he ventured beyond the due bounds of decorum. Hilarity
and beauty danced to the most delicious notes of
harmony; till the rosy finger of Aurora pointed to the
hour at which the quinquennial festivities should close.
Perhaps to many the visions of the night brought back
the joys of the day, and the feet danced, the heart
throbbed, and the cheek glowed, when the eye-lids
were closed in sleep.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(Fuss) [a low cant word] a tumult, a bustle. Swift.</p>

<p>(Un) Aunt&mdash;a title usually given to an elderly woman.</p>

<p>(Vean) [Cornish for little] Cheel Vean&mdash;little Child.</p>

<p>(Tarving) [a cant word] struggling, convulsions, <i>Tarvings</i>.</p>

<p>(Fang) [Saxon] to gripe, receive, &amp;c. Shakespear.</p>

<p>(Maze-gerry Pattick) a mad brutish or frolicsome fool.</p>

<p>(Midjans and Jouds) shreds and tatters.</p>

<p>(Noans) [Nonce] on purpose.</p>

<p>(Clom Buzza) a coarse earthen pot.</p>

<p>(Scoans) the pavement. (Showl) a shovel. (Steeve) stave.</p>

<p>(Scat) to give a blow, to break. (Chacks) cheeks.</p>

<p>(Murely) almost. (Baal'd) mischievously beaten.</p>

<p>(Bazzom) of a blue or purple colour.</p>

<p>(Muggety Pye) a pye made of sheeps guts, parsley and cream,
pepper and salt. (Clunk) swallow. (Croom) crumb.</p>

<p>(Mashes) a great many, number, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(Mabjers) Mab Hens&mdash;young fowls two-thirds grown.</p>

<p>(Pillas) [Pilez&mdash;Cornish] the <i>avena nuda</i> or naked oats of Ray;
bald, bare or naked oats without husks.</p>

<p>(Hoggan) Hogan in Cornish British signifies a Hawthorn berry;

<p>(Neyne weeks)&mdash;as though they had been married but nine
weeks, whereas in the third line, she is addressed by Un Mally as
'long wetha Cheeld vean.' This will be readily explained by
noticing a custom very prevalent among the lower ranks of the
county, as will appear by the following anecdote. A friend of mine
who was one year an officer in one of the mining parishes, told me
that of fifty-five couples married during that year, it was <i>manifest</i>
by the appearance of fifty of the ladies, that they ought to have
been married several moons before. A young man, to the honor
of the county be it said, (even if the practice be to its disparagement)
needs no compulsion to marry his lass when in this condition.</p>

<p>(Nackin) Handkerchief. (Preen) Penryn. (Pooted) kicked.</p>

<p>(Fangings) gettings or wages. (Viestes) Fists.</p></blockquote>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sea-girt cliff, the stormy heath;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Steals to the silent sleeping string,</span><br />
And wildly brushing, wakes with sweetest swell,<br />
The plaintive trembling spirit of the shell.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That pour'd the instructive truth profound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here Cornwall's sons that voice rever'd,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where sullen silence sleeps around.</span><br />
See where she sung, sad, melancholy, tread,<br />
A pensive pilgrim o'er th' unconscious dead.<br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sons to the darken'd world of yore!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lur'd by whose eagle-pinion'd fame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The stranger left his native shore,</span><br />
Daring, his white sail to the winds he gave,<br />
And sought fair knowledge o'er the distant wave.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tho' few these awful rocks revere,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And temples that deserted lie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The muse shall ask the tenderest tear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That ever dropt from Pity's eye,</span><br />
T' embalm the ruins that her sighs deplore,<br />
Where Wisdom, Virtue dwelt, but dwell no more.<br />

Rome appeared to me unfavourable. These are head-aches arising
from a tendency to a fullness about the head. In many cases
among the English residents, I found persons not previously subject
to head-aches affected with them here, and some already liable
to them had been aggravated. Apoplexy, I was told, was at one
time so frequent at Rome that a day of public fasting was ordered,
and a particular form of prayer addressed to St. Anthony to avert
so dreadful a calamity from the Holy city."</p></div>

Dr. Walcot was apprenticed to his uncle, who was an
apothecary at Fowey in Cornwall, and after having practised for
some years in the West Indies, he settled as a Physician at Truro:
after residing there for some time, he suddenly quitted the county,
in consequence of a law suit in which he was engaged against the
Corporation of Truro; the dispute related to the right of their
putting upon him a parish apprentice; when he sold his effects,
shut up his house, and informed the officers that if they were determined
to carry their point, they might put the apprentice into
the empty building, as he should never enter it again.</p></div></div>
